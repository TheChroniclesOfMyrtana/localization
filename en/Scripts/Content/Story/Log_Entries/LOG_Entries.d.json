  "LOG_GQ001_Dickon_Jorn": "Felix saw two men carry their drunken companion through the gate. Apparently one of them was as fat as a barrel and the other as thin as a pike. The sentry, however, did not remember the appearance of the drunkard. From what he told me, they took the road towards the town. Could it be the kidnappers?",
  "LOG_GQ001_Hunter_Trace_V1": "I met a hunter busy tracking down a beast just north of the village. He told me that three people had passed through the area some time ago. According to him, the tracks led towards the town.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Hunter_Trace_V2": "I met a hunter busy tracking down a beast just north of the village. He told me that three people had passed through the area some time ago. One of them was fat, the other thin, and the footprints of the third one were irregular as if he had been dragged by the other two. According to the hunter, the footprints led towards the town.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Folkard_Jorn": "It seems that Folkard knows about Jorn's disappearance as little as I do. He says that if my brother has indeed been kidnapped, only the city guard can help, but he thinks I shouldn't jump to conclusions so hastily. Maybe he is right and informing the authorities is a good idea?",
  "LOG_GQ001_Sweeping": "All it took was a little broom work and I didn't have to wait long for the results. I managed to find one of my uncle's two missing pouches.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Sweeping2": "There's another pouch.",
  "LOG_GQ001_SweepingRing": "While searching the uncle’s hut, I found a strange ring with a blue stone. Did it belong to the kidnapper?",
  "LOG_GQ001_HungryTerry": "On the road from the village to the town, I met Terry, a wandering singer, who sang me a song. Since he walks these roads, perhaps he saw someone or something suspicious? The vagabond agreed to talk with me if I bring him something to eat. A chunk of fried meat should be enough.",
  "LOG_GQ001_TerryNotHungry": "After Terry had snacked a bit, he told me that last evening he had met three men on the road. One of them was big and fat, another was skinny, and the one they were dragging along was bald. Now I’m sure that the vagabond saw Jorn and his captors. From what he told me, they went north towards the city. There's no time to waste. I have to save my brother!",
  "LOG_GQ001_JornAndBridge": "I decided to go on the bridge where Jorn and I had recently rested, hoping to find some trace of my brother. Unfortunately, there was no sign of Jorn or anything to indicate that he had passed this way.",

  "LOG_GQ001_HarryV1": "Harry says he hasn't seen my brother lately. Maybe I should take a look around just to be sure?",
  "LOG_GQ001_HarryV2": "Harry says he hasn't seen my brother lately. He thinks though that one of us could be responsible for his kidnapping. His opinion on that doesn’t surprise me. The guy was against us the moment we set foot in the village. Maybe I should take a look around just to be sure?",
  "LOG_GQ001_Kipper": "Kipper hasn't seen anyone that looked like my brother, and he knows little more than the others about the break into Kurt’s hut.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Otho": "A shepherd by the name of Otho saw a big guy leading a man out of Kurt's hut. As he tried to take a closer look at the incident, another person grabbed him from behind and threatened to kill him. Fortunately, they let the shepherd go. I don't know if I should believe the words of this strange man. On the other hand, he looked very scared, and why should he lie?",
  "LOG_GQ001_Rasco": "Rasco claims that there were some strange noises coming from Kurt's cabin that resembled a cave troll. He may have heard the sounds of Jorn fighting his captors.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Viktor": "Viktor had mentioned that Rik and Otho occasionally made trouble in the village, but he didn't suspect they had anything to do with the incident. He advised me to talk to the village sentries.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Start": "When I got back to Kurt, it seems that during his absence Jorn had gone missing, and the mess in the hut points to the kidnapping. I can't get my thoughts together. I have more questions than answers. But I know one thing - I need to act quickly. Kurt advised me to question the sentries if they witnessed anything suspicious. I could also talk to the other people in the village. Maybe any of them saw or heard something? In the meantime, my uncle will try to convince the Elder to start looking for my brother.",
  "LOG_GQ001_FoundYourGoldV1": "I decided to return Kurt the pouches I found in his hut. My uncle wanted to give me some coins for my trouble, but I refused. He will make better use of that gold right now.",

  "LOG_GQ001_RingV2": "I handed Kurt the strange ring, hoping that it would somehow lead us to Jorn. My uncle promised to give the find to his friend in the town, who supposedly might know something about it. At worst, Kurt will sell it and split the profit with me.",
  "LOG_GQ001_AnyInformationJorn": "I spoke with Kurt and told him about my findings. Unfortunately, he didn’t manage to convince the elder to help us search for Jorn. It looks like nobody in the village is eager or capable to do so. I’ll have to find a way to get into the town. Kurt told me that I should ask the City Guard or the Merchant Guild for help. He also assured me that he’ll join me as soon as he can. Once I reach Archolos, I should go to ‘Siren’s Wail’, a tavern in the harbour.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Maiwen": "In the evening, Maiwen had seen some suspicious, stocky guy hanging around the back of the inn and near the river. It was just a few steps away from Kurt's hut. She says that a moment later, an older man ran into the inn. He rushed to the back room and after that went outside with Viktor. I guess it was Kurt. It seems like Maiwen must have spotted this guy moments after the kidnapping.",
  "LOG_GQ001_Myrmidon": "I got word from Slasher that Big Ben was most likely behind the kidnapping. His appearance and methods seem somewhat familiar. From what I’ve learned, Ben is widely feared even by the biggest scoundrels in the Haven. I should go to Cortez and ask him where I can find this big guy.",
  "LOG_Q101_First": "Starting that diary wasn't such a bad idea after all. At least I have something to keep my head busy. Jorn says we’ll soon be arriving at Archolos. I hope his plan to find our uncle will work. We’re still pretty far from the shore. Maybe it’s a good moment to get to know some people down here?",
  "LOG_Q101_TimoIsDown": "When we got close to the shoals, the smugglers' captain ordered us to come aboard. It turned out that Timo hadn't paid for the boat that was meant to take us to the beach. After a short argument, the captain pulled out his blade and killed Timo. Pity, but I decided to keep my head down. I didn't want to end up gutted out before reaching the shore.",
  "LOG_Q101_TimoIntervention": "When we got close to the shoals, the smugglers' captain ordered us to come aboard. It turned out that Timo hadn't paid for the boat that was meant to take us to the beach. After a short argument the captain pulled out his blade, but I decided to intervene.",

  "LOG_Q101_Flora": "Ezekiel's daughter is scared to death of her first sea voyage. Well, when we get to the shore, she'll probably calm down pretty quickly.",
  "LOG_Q101_Fabio": "I met a bully by the name of Fabio that seems to be very irritated. Probably it will be best to leave him be.",
  "LOG_Q101_Rupert": "Rupert, a boy who hasn’t spoken a word during the entire journey, runs from getting enlisted in the army. He thinks of himself as a man of reason. If he had got recruited, he would probably have died at the front already.",

  "LOG_Q101_Rupert_Hungry": "Rupert has asked me to get any meat, but the pirates are hiding all the valuable goods out of our reach. I guess I have no choice but to hunt for something below deck.",
  "LOG_Q101_Rupert_Recipe": "Rupert gave me a recipe for rat skewers. Sounds terrible. Maybe these ingredients on the list will make it taste better? I should collect everything before preparing the meal on the stove.",
  "LOG_Q101_Vrazka_LostAmulet": "One of the pirates had stolen Vrazka's box and took it to the hold at the back of the ship. The woman claims that the boards there make loud creaking noises. Maybe the pirate made himself a secret stash?",
  "LOG_Q101_Vrazka_Ship": "The boards in this place are creaking really loud. Maybe some of them could be pried open?",
  "LOG_Q101_Vrazka_FoundChest": "I retrieved the stolen box for Vrazka. In return, she promised me help from her friends on Archolos after we reach the shore. Maybe life here won't be so bad after all?",
  "LOG_Q101_Smuggler_Idea": "I found a bottle of grog in one of the chests. Perhaps the drink will convince the pirate to tell me something interesting?",
  "LOG_Q102_Beach": "With some problems, we managed to get to the shore of Archolos. I just can’t wait to see what the island has to offer us.",

  "LOG_Q102_Finish_FabioWay": "Harry, the sentry, let me into the village. It seems that Jorn has already got here. I can find him at Bastian’s inn. To get there, I have to follow the road, at the first fork turn right and pass the bridge. The inn will be on my left.",
  "LOG_Q102_Fabio_FoundMagicCircle": "In the cave, I found a place that looks like a tomb of some kind. In the middle of it, I can see a curious magical symbol. Perhaps I should tell Fabio about it?",

  "LOG_Q103_JornInjured": "It seems that at the time I was heading to the village, my brother was stung by the bloodfly, and regular medications do not seem to help him. Viktor told me that my uncle, Kurt, has always gotten along with the local alchemists and could help me find a remedy for Jorn. His hut is behind Sir Ramsey’s manor, right by the river.

They erected a chapel to Innos in the city of Archolos, and then set out with an army of paladins to capture the fortress of Vardhal. Wirgilio sent down a rain of fire, completely destroying the fortress, but killing many of his own soldiers in the process. In the coming weeks, he descended further and further into madness and fanaticism, unable to understand why he could not summon that power again to take the Wolf's Den. Eventually he committed a vicious murder on innocent villagers, leading to a riot and his death. When the ghost I met arrived on the scene and attempted to control the crowd, he was hit with a stone and mindlessly responded with fire.

  "LOG_BESTIARY_RATSWAMP": "SWAMP RAT\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Marshes\\nADVICE: Looks like a cross between a molerat and a giant rat. Due to its fat body, it moves and fights like the former.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_RATBLACK": "BLACK RAT\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Forests near human settlements\\nADVICE: Much larger than other rat species, and therefore much more resistant to damage. Like other rats, it will often choose carrion over combat.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_GIANTBUG": "FIELD RAIDER\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Fire, Magic, Wind/Fall\\nLOCATION: Farmland\\nADVICE: Despite their large size, they are not very tough. They often feed in larger groups, but it is very easy to lure out individuals who are virtually defenseless when charging.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_GIANTBUGFOREST": "FOREST RAIDER\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Fire, Magic, Edge\\nLOCATION: Forests, cultivated fields near forests\\nADVICE: In contrast to field raiders, they are much more resistant and can bite really hard. Their dark carapaces camouflage them perfectly in dark dens. At night you might not even notice them!",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_SNAPPER": "SNAPPER\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Wind/Fall\\nLOCATION: Mountainous Areas\\nADVICE: These extremely fast beasts always hunt in packs. They approach their prey slowly at first, watching them constantly, but once they throw themselves into the attack, there is no escaping them. The best tactic is to dodge their charge and attack in the back while the beast turns.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_RAZOR": "RAZOR\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic, Wind/Fall\\nLOCATION: Mountainous areas. They can adapt to any terrain where they find game.\\nADVICE: Razors tend to hunt in slightly smaller groups than snappers, but they are also much more dangerous than them. Combat tactics against them are said to be like those of their smaller cousins.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_SNAPPERDRAGON": "DRAGON SNAPPER\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Edge, Blunt\\nVULNERABILITY: Wind/Fall\\nLOCATION: Mountainous areas. They often venture into other areas in search of suitable prey.\\nADVICE: These beasts can tear even a heavily armored warrior to shreds in the blink of an eye. Their main weakness is their movements, which are reminiscent of those of other snappers - a skilled swordsman can evade their attack, but even a single mistake can prove fatal. Of course, you can also try to break their bones with the Fist of Wind spell, but most daredevils end up in the monster's belly a moment after casting the first spell.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_GOLEMSTONE": "STONE GOLEM\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Fall\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles, Wind/Fall, Fire, Edge\\nVULNERABILITY: Blunt\\nLOCATION: Mountainous terrain, rocky passages\\nADVICE: If you can avoid it, do so. Most golems are adamant about guarding their territory - when their peace is not disturbed, they do not engage in combat. If you do have to fight one, prepare a blunt weapon - other weapons are practically ineffective. A potion of free fall will be an additional advantage - Golems can throw their opponents many meters away.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_GOLEMSWAMP": "SWAMP GOLEM\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE Fall\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles, Wind/Fall, Magic, Edge\\nVULNERABILITY: Blunt, Fire\\nLOCATION: Swamps\\nADVICE: Slightly weaker than their stone counterparts, but just as dangerous. The behaviors of both species are very similar, making the tactics for fighting them little different either. Their susceptibility to fire is difficult to exploit due to their considerable protection against magic - it's best to prepare very strong fire spells. At all costs avoid fighting in water - golems, due to their mass and size, simply move on the bottom and can still crush with their powerful fists.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_SKELETONS": "Skeleton\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge, Blunt, Projectiles\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles, Edge\\nVULNERABILITY: Blunt, Wind/Fall\\nLOCATION: Desecrated Graveyards, Ruins\\nLOCATION: Most skeletons use the type of weapon they used when they were alive. This is why you can find all sorts of skeletons - warriors, archers and crossbowmen. Their bones are extremely difficult to damage with a blade or an arrow, but a solid blunt weapon, a fist of wind or a fall from a height can easily turn them into a pile of dust. Despite the fragility of their bodies, every blow from these cursed creatures is incredibly powerful. Due to their location, they often attack in groups - which makes them even more dangerous opponents.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_BOARS": "BOAR\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Blunt\\nRESISTANCE: Edge\\nVULNERABILITY: Fire, Magic\\nLOCATION: Forests\\nADVICE: Despite appearances, they strike more often with their massive heads than with their fangs - it is best to prepare your armor for blunt damage and evade like wolves.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_BATS": "BAT\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Edge, Blunt\\nVULNERABILITY: Wind/Fall, Projectiles\\nLOCATION: Dark caves, urban sewers\\nADVICE: They sleep most of the day hanging their heads down. When awakened, they jump at their opponent, then rise into the air and attack by circling above their head. When they are asleep, they are easily avoided by sneaking under their resting place. Like Harpies, their wings are easily damaged by a gust of wind.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_TURTLE": "MUDTURTE\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles, Edge\\nVULNERABILITY: Blunt, Magic\\nLOCATION: Wetlands, near bodies of water\\nADVICE: The thick shells on their backs make them unresponsive to blows and constantly cut the legs of their attackers with their extremely sharp teeth. They move very slowly - use this to your advantage.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_CRAB": "CRAB\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Blunt\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles, Edge\\nVULNERABILITY: Blunt, Magic\\nLOCATION: Beaches\\nADVICE: Their thick armor makes them unresponsive to blows and they do not interrupt attacks with their pincers.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_ZOMBIE": "ZOMBIE\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Blunt\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles\\nVulnerability: Edge\\nLOCATION: Desecrated graveyards, swamps\\nADVICE: Extremely slow, but very tough and resistant to damage. Despite their decaying bodies, they do not react to blows dealt to them. Even a single jerk from these tortured creatures can kill a human. Many of them lie in wait, pretending to be dead, in order to attack the unsuspecting wanderer by surprise.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_MOLERAT": "MOLERAT\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Fire, Magic\\nLOCATION: Caves, shady clearings\\nADVICE: Their fat bodies offer little protection, but don't underestimate them - moles, especially in groups, can be deadly.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_LIZARD": "LIZARD\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Fire\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Beaches, rivers and reservoirs\\nADVICE: Despite their large size they are not very tough. The most dangerous are their charges and jumps - thanks to their long body and tail they can quickly change the distance between themselves and their prey.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_ALLIGATOR": "ALIGATOR\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Swamps, canals, near bodies of water\\nADVICE: Less resilient than swamp lizards, but much more aggressive and dangerous - their razor-sharp fangs can do a lot of damage.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_LIZARDSWAMP": "SWAMP LIZARD\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Swamps\\nADVICE: Much tougher than their normal counterpart. Hard scales protect them best from physical damage.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_LIZARDFIRE": "FIRE LIZARD\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Fire\\nRESISTANCE: Fire, Projectiles\\nVulnerability: Wind/Fall\\nLOCATION: Beaches, burned areas\\nADVANCE: Each of their bites sets the victim's skin on fire, causing even more severe wounds. They fight like other lizards and often travel in groups, making them a formidable challenge even for experienced warriors.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_Bloodfly": "BLOODFLY\\nTYPE OF INJURY: Incisive\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Glades, near bodies of water\\nADVICE: Keep your position higher - climb a small rock or provoke it to fly to the hill you are standing on. Avoid high ledges, you may fall down with the bloodsucker in the confusion, and only he can fly.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_BloodflyRiver": "RIVER BLOODFLY\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Rivers and other bodies of water\\nADVICE: They fight exactly like normal bloodflies, the only difference is their greater endurance and sharper stinger.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_BloodflySwamp": "SWAMP BLOODFLY\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Magic\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles\\nVULNERABILITY: Magic, Fire\\nLOCATION: Swamps\\nADVICE: For their small size they are quite tough. Unlike other bloodflies, they prefer spitting acid, they only attack with their stinger when the opponent is very close.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_LURKER": "LURKER\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nVULNERABILITY: Fire, Magic\\nLOCATION: Beaches, rivers and reservoirs\\nADVICE: Their stride is very sluggish, but they can attack with their paws from a great distance. They usually circle their opponent to strike a blow from the side. They often feed in groups and are then extremely dangerous - when one individual occupies the attention of the prey, another one immediately starts to attack.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_LURKERSEA": "SEA LURKER\\nTYPE OF Damage: Edge\\nRESISTANCE: None\\nABILITY: Magic\\nLOCATION: Beaches\\nADVICE: They live in much smaller groups than their normal counterparts, but despite this, they use very similar fighting tactics. Due to their environment, they are much more resilient and can hit extremely hard with their paws used for swimming.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_DRONE": "SWAMP DRONE\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Magic\\nRESISTANCE: Blunt, Wind/Fall\\nVulnerability: Projectiles, Fire\\nLOCATION: Swamps\\nADVICE: It's best to kill from a distance - as they die, they emit a poisonous gas around them, which can lead to the death of the person inhaling it. They fight by spitting toxic venom at a very short distance, so in most cases they try to get as close to their attacker as possible.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_DRONESWAMP": "SEWER DRONE\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Magic\\nRESISTANCE: Blunt, Wind/Fall\\nVULNERABILITY: Projectiles, Fire\\nLOCATION: Sewers\\nADVICE: Smaller and less dangerous than their swamp cousins, but their post-mortem gas can still be deadly. Especially dangerous in groups though they usually travel alone.",
  "LOG_BESTIARY_FROGMAN": "FROGMAN\\nTYPE OF DAMAGE: Blunt, Projectiles\\nRESISTANCE: Projectiles\\nVULNERABILITY: Edge\\nLOCATION: Forests near rivers, wetlands\\nADVICE: Despite their large size, their thin skin and meagre armor make them vulnerable to damage. They are not to be underestimated, however, as they can hit pretty hard down with their big, spiky mace.",
  "LOG_SEED_WHO": "Some animal species are particularly fond of certain plants, so you can find the seeds of the corresponding plants in their stomachs:\\nSCAVENGER - Meadow Knotweed\\nRATS - Healing Plant\\nGOBLINS - Healing Herb\\nFIELD AND FOREST RAIDERS - Healing Root\\nMOLERATS - Fire Nettle\\nBOAR - Fireweed\\nLURKER - Fire Root\\nBLOODFLIES - Blue Elder",
  "LOG_Trader_OldCity_Ernesto": "Ernesto has agreed to let me buy his extraordinary wines from him. He runs his inn in the Old Town.",

  "LOG_SQ414_WrongWaterfall": "Hmmm... I don't see anything interesting here... I think it was about a different waterfall...",
  "LOG_Q108_Kurt_SearchLokvar_WeKnowHim": "Kurt still wants to talk to Jorn. In the meantime, he sent me to the village Water Mage for something that might help my brother. Lokvar supposedly owes my uncle some kind of favor, so he should agree when I mention it.",
  "LOG_SQ309_WoodenInnos": "As it turns out, the Innoses are not golden at all, but wooden, and then they are just gilded. Now I am to go into the workshop and talk to a woman named Mia about the details of the work.",
  "LOG_QA304_DontGoAway": "I shouldn't be going anywhere. We should take advantage of the night and finish the job.",
  "LOG_KQ407_AboutSQ414": "Grayson plans to rid the island of orc camps. If I help him, I might be able to convince Tonan return to Haunted Tower after all.",
  "LOG_SQ414_NotYet": "Tonan is not going to move to Haunted Tower because of the orcs stationed at Bermar's farm. I'm unlikely to be able to clear it myself, and even if I do, it doesn't guarantee that more of their troops won't show up there. I guess I'll just have to wait for things to develop and for a chance to get rid of those orcs.",
  "LOG_SQ414_NoMoreOrcs_V1": "Tonan doesn't quite believe we've cleared Bermar's farm, but he's agreed to head out to check it out. If there aren't any orcs on the farm, he'll head to the haunted tower with me.",
  "LOG_SQ414_NoMoreOrcs_V2": "Tonan doesn't quite believe we've cleared Bermar's farm, but he's agreed to head out to check it out. If there are no orcs on the farm, he'll head to the tower with me.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Thunder": "Damage from lightning spells is much higher during rain and when the victim is in water.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Fire": "The damage from fire spells is much less effective when it rains.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_FireArmor": "Fire magic is still magic, and as far as defence is concerned, I have to approach it like other spells. Being burned after being hit by a fireball or a non-magical weapon is a different matter.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Fly": "No armor can protect against injuries from falling or flying. For a human, the only salvation can be learning acrobatics. The heavier the opponent, the more resistant he is to this type of damage.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Magic": "Many monsters react differently to different types of magic. Creatures made of stone cannot withstand an onslaught of water spells, and winged monsters will fall to the ground after a lightning bolt is sent at them.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Edge": "The most common damage in combat is edge damage. Hardly anything is immune to it, but in few fights it gives a significant advantage.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Blunt": "Blunt damage will work great against heavy armor, bones, or boulders.",
  "LOG_GoodAdvice_Point": "There is no point in using a bow or crossbow against a stone monster or one with thick skin. Hitting a skeleton with arrows is also not the easiest thing to do.",
  "LOG_NoMoreGoldMine": "Looks like the gold mine will be closed for quite some time. I don't think I'll be mining any more new nuggets. I can always sell what I already have to their blacksmith.",

  "LOG_NewsBoard_Silbach_Carden": "The hunter Carden from the village of Silbach needs to replenish his supply of skins. He will pay if I bring him wolf, rat and boar skins.

  "LOG_SQ225_OnFarm_AfterViktorIdea": "Time to start sabotaging. I can pretend to be a worker and damage the grape bushes. It'll be good to steal tools from the warehouse, and there's also destroying grain as a field raider - though with the latter it's best to wait until the evening.
