  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_HELLO_03_02": "Good shape is a must if you want to keep up with them.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_HELLO_03_03": "Today we're going to test what kind of pace you're keeping and how fast your legs will get into your butts.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_HELLO_03_04": "Plus, I'll have a surprise for you guys that I prepared along the way.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_HELLO_03_05": "Get to work boys, follow me!",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Silence_03_01": "When shooting a bow or crossbow, you have to be in perfect control of your breathing.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Silence_03_02": "After a long run, even an experienced shooter can have trouble with accuracy.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Silence_03_03": "I don't mention it randomly, as I have come up with a good test of your skills.",

  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Silence_03_06": "Your job is to hit one of them. We will stay here until at least one apple falls.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Silence_03_08": "One more thing! Don't let anyone try to get any closer than the distance where I'm standing. Considering your skill at shooting, you'll be dead if the enemy gets that close.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_03_01": "Recruits, halt!",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Wait_15_01": "Why are we stopping?",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Wait_03_02": "Did I let you speak, boy?",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Target_Wait_03_03": "Remember, you only speak to people of higher rank when asked.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_AppleResult_03_06": "When shooting, composure matters most, but very often a good guard is a fast guard.",

  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_AppleResult_03_01": "At least one of you managed it. You were procrastinating so much I was afraid I'd fall asleep here.",

  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_AppleResult_03_03": "Congratulations, boy! I didn't expect that from you, but you hit them.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_AppleResult_03_04": "You'll have to work on your shooting position a bit more, but I can see you have the makings for a ranged unit.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_AppleResult_03_05": "We'll move on to the final task then.",
  "DIA_Instructor_FMQ001_Cheater_03_01": "Didn't you hear what I said? Being deaf won't help you be a good shot either!",
