  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_food_12_03": "What's going on here?!",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_food_16_04": "Some tramps have come and are soiling my floor! They want food, but there's no gold in sight!",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_food_12_05": "They're barely alive... They won't be able to cause us trouble, and Adanos tells us to help those in need.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_food_16_06": "You leave Adanos out of this! Help them yourself if you want, but leave me out of this!",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_food_12_07": "What do you need?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SomethingElse_12_01": "Anything else?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_Thanksforhelp_15_00": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_Thanksforhelp_12_01": "You're welcome. Martha usually reacts quite nervously to surprises.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_Thanksforhelp_12_02": "What's your name, by the way?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_Thanksforhelp_15_03": "I'm Marvin.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_Thanksforhelp_12_04": "Marvin... Where did you come from and what are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_talklater_15_00": "I'm sorry, but could we postpone this conversation until later? I'm exhausted from the trip.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_talklater_12_01": "There should be some spare bed in the room upstairs.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_talklater_15_02": "Again, a hundred thanks.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_escapewar_15_00": "With my brother, we fled from Londram because of war.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_escapewar_15_01": "When we heard of the approaching orcs, we decided to take the smugglers' ship.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_escapewar_15_02": "After reaching the shore, we set off in search of the village. Some people stayed in a cave near the beach.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_escapewar_12_03": "Then you were very lucky. The woods around Silbach are not the safest places on the island.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_escapewar_12_04": "I advise you not to venture into them alone, especially at night...",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_escapewar_12_05": "I'll try to convince the sentries to let the rest of your companions through to the village without further ado.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_drink_15_00": "Do you have anything strong? After my recent experiences, I need a drink.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_drink_12_01": "Talk to Bastian, our innkeeper. He's the guy behind the counter.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_hurt_15_00": "My brother's hurt. He's been bitten by bloodflies and needs help.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_hurt_12_01": "We have one water mage in the village, but... but there's nothing but problems with him.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_hurt_12_02": "I'll see what I can do. It's possible that the barber's help will be necessary.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_foodandwarmcorner_15_00": "Food and a warm corner.",
  "DIA_Martha_Q103_Hello_foodandwarmcorner_12_01": "I think it can be arranged. There's no shortage of food or spare rooms at this inn.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_15_00": "What the... what's going on?",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_12_01": "Forgive me for waking you so early, but the rest of your companions have just arrived in the village.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_12_02": "They told us exactly the same story as you, so the sentries let them in without much trouble.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_12_03": "They told the sentries the whole story.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_12_04": "It was a bit of a stretch, but they were eventually allowed inside.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_Jorn_15_01": "Have you been to see Jorn? How is he today?",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_Jorn_12_02": "Martha has given him an herbal infusion and regularly applies compresses to the wound, but he is still very weak.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_Jorn_12_03": "Looks like you can't do without the help of a barber or alchemist.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_Jorn_12_04": "If I were you, I'd talk to your uncle. From what I remember, he got along well with the local alchemists.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_Jorn_12_05": "If you need anything, you can find me here at the inn.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_where_15_01": "Where are the rest of my comrades now?",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_where_12_02": "They should be on their way to the inn. Looks like I'll have to prepare extra beds and Martha will have to cook more stew...",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_kurt_15_01": "Have you seen Kurt anywhere along the way?",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_kurt_12_02": "Unfortunately, no. Looks like you'll have to check in with him yourself.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_kurt_15_03": "Where exactly does he live?",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_kurt_12_04": "When you leave the inn, you should turn left towards Sir Ramsey's mansion, and then left again before you reach the hill on which the building stands.",
  "DIA_Viktor_WakeUp_kurt_12_05": "There you will find several huts tightly packed next to each other. Kurt lives in the largest of them, right by the river.",
  "DIA_Viktor_AboutSilbach_15_00": "What can you tell me about the village?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_15_00": "Does a man named Kurt live here?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_12_01": "Yes, he does. Do you know him?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_15_02": "He's mine and Jorn's uncle.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_12_03": "Oh, really? You should have said so right away, then maybe I wouldn't even have to stand up for you!",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_15_04": "When a person is barely alive, food and a comfortable bed are the first things that come to mind.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_12_05": "You can say that again!",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_15_06": "Will you show us his hut in the morning?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Kurtlive_12_07": "I may not have to. Word of your arrival will spread quickly, and Kurt will probably be among the first to arrive at the inn.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Problem_15_00": "Won't we get you in trouble?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Problem_12_01": "Even if, don't worry about it. I don't think I'll face the pillory.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Problem_12_02": "Besides, I have the support of Bastian and Martha. Nobody's going to mess with them!",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_15_00": "What do you know about the missing sentry?",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_12_01": "About Hendrik?",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_12_02": "About a week ago, he went to the woods to relieve himself and disappeared without a trace.",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_12_03": "He kept complaining about the local booze, so everyone thought he went to the city to get drunk.",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_12_04": "But when he didn't return the next day, we started searching.",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_12_05": "Well, we found him yesterday. Some wild beasts got him.",
  "DIA_Viktor_LostGuard_12_06": "The fang marks on his body were deep and huge. I had never seen anything like it in my life!",
  "DIA_Viktor_teachaboutplants_15_00": "You wouldn't happen to know who could teach me something about plants?",
  "DIA_Viktor_teachaboutplants_12_01": "The easiest way is to go to one of the alchemists.",
  "DIA_Viktor_teachaboutplants_12_02": "The closest one I know is Bodowin. By day he stays in his workshop, north of the village.",
  "DIA_Viktor_teachaboutplants_12_03": "You can also try your luck with our mage Lokvar.",
  "DIA_Viktor_whereisLokvar_15_00": "Where can I find Lokvar?",
  "DIA_Viktor_whereisLokvar_12_01": "He lives in his hut, near the chapel. The easiest way is to go towards the southern gate of the village, and then turn west.",
  "DIA_Viktor_whereisLokvar_12_02": "Just warning you - the old man has his moods.",
  "DIA_Viktor_whereisLokvar_15_03": "Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.",
  "DIA_Viktor_whereisLokvar_12_04": "No problem. Good luck!",
  "DIA_Viktor_WhatsGoingOn_15_01": "What are all these people doing here?",
  "DIA_Viktor_WhatsGoingOn_12_02": "Your best bet is to talk to your uncle about it.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_01": "I heard what happened. I feel for you, I really do.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_15_02": "Thanks, but instead of sympathy I could use some information.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_15_03": "Do you know anything more about the break-in?",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_04": "Some time ago, Kurt came to me and asked for a spirit tea. He said that Jorn had gotten worse and was delirious again.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_05": "I asked Martha to prepare the brew and went to check on how your brother was doing.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_06": "Kurt entered the shack first and as soon as he crossed the threshold, he started cursing left and right. I ran in after him and saw the carnage and no sign of Jorn.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_15_07": "You didn't see anything suspicious?",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_08": "I don't... I don't think so. If it was a kidnapping, then this person had to know what they were doing, and I'm pretty sure it was an outsider.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_15_09": "It's no secret that the locals don't like us. You don't suspect any of them?",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_10": "We have a few people here who give us trouble from time to time, such as Rik or Otho. The people in the village are rather quiet, which can't be said for the townspeople.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_15_11": "Do you often have people from the city visiting you?",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_12": "Quite often, or at least it was until the recent downpours. Now it's a little less frequent. The trails have become dangerous. Wild animals and bandits everywhere.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_13": "If I were you, I'd talk to the sentries. If it was a visitor, they must have seen him.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_15_14": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Viktor_GQ001afterkurt_12_15": "I know it's not much, but if you still need anything, look me up.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_15_01": "Do you know where I could get some medicine?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_12_02": "I have no idea. I'm not an alchemist or a barber.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_15_03": "You've lived in this village your whole life. Surely you must know something!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_12_04": "Okay, but you have to promise me you didn't hear it from me.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_15_05": "I promise.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_12_06": "There should be some supplies in the storehouse in case the plague that decimated the population of this island many years ago returns.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_15_07": "Thanks, that's good enough for me.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_12_08": "Oh, and one more thing. Watch out for Gabrien. He's the one who guards the warehouse every day.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_12_09": "He is an exceptional stickler, and when he is on watch, not even a mouse will slip through.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ103_Potion_Potion_12_10": "They say he's so preoccupied with the work that he stays up all night, making it possible for him to work longer than others.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Thanks_15_01": "Thanks, that's all I needed to know.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Thanks_03_02": "No problem.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Thanks_03_03": "By the way, let me know if you learn anything new about Jorn.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_01": "How can I help you?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_15_02": "Bastian said you've had a few uniformed men visit you recently.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_03": "That's right... they weren't the most pleasant guests we've had here. They were constantly yelling and harassing the women.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_04": "In fact, if it weren't for their uniforms, I'd never say they resembled city guards. Although, on the other hand, that doesn't surprise me very much.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_05": "Lately, the quality of Roderich's people has left much to be desired.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_15_06": "Do you remember if there was a man named Gerwin among them?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_07": "Gerwin, Gerwin...",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_08": "I think I heard one of them mention the name, but I didn't talk to them so I wouldn't accidentally get punched in the mouth. I already have enough problems with Martha anyway.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_09": "At this rate, we'll be safer with the first better hoodlums than city guards.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_03_10": "Well, unless by some miracle they promote you to commander!",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_15_01": "Am I interrupting?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_03_02": "Of course not, officer.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_03_03": "Not so long ago I was serving you stew, and look at you today! I see you've found some new friends.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_03_04": "I just might take a break for a while, but literally a while.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_MIL_15_01": "More out of reason, you might say, than out of a sincere desire to seek friends.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_MIL_03_02": "That's what I thought. You're far from a brawling drunk.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Brother_15_01": "Only with the help of the city guard am I able to find my brother.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Brother_03_02": "Looking at what they've been doing lately, I doubt it, but I sincerely hope you find him eventually.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Long_15_01": "Did they sit at the inn long?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Long_03_02": "They ordered a keg of beer and gulped it down late into the night. They probably would have stayed like that until morning, but Bastian finally chased them out because he had to close the place.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Long_15_03": "Do you remember which way they went?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Long_03_04": "North, towards the woods. Maybe they'll be of some use and finally get some order out of these rascals.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Bandit_15_01": "Do you have a problem with bandits here?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Bandit_03_02": "We've had a problem with them for a good few months now.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Bandit_03_03": "Usually, they limited themselves to stealing crops and goods left unattended by peasants. Recently, however, they have become more brazen.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Bandit_03_04": "They're attacking fishermen, woodcutters and diggers. Yeah! They robbed a whole convoy of merchants and cut down the guards!",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Bandit_03_05": "I'm not surprised that the Elder finally decided to reinforce the watch on the outskirts of the village. The situation is getting worse by the day.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Visual_15_01": "You paid attention to their appearance. Why?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Visual_03_02": "They looked like ordinary citizens who wore the uniforms of city guards. Their belt buckles stood out, their collars were tattered, and they themselves were dirty and unshaven.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Visual_03_03": "I thought the guards had some standards.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_15_01": "I have an unusual case.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_03_02": "From you, Marvin, we can't expect anything else. Shoot.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_15_03": "Do you know how to impress Martha?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_03_04": "Who would have thought? Martha caught your eye? Not so long ago, I'd have thought you were going to kill each other!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_Yes_15_01": "The quarrels of lovers... and all that.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_Yes_03_02": "Hm... I know she loves being at the Great Vineyard, especially the orchard there. She always talks about that place with great fondness.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_Yes_03_03": "You should feed her, too. It always works. Worse, Martha is the best cook on the island, so it's hard to impress her.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_Yes_03_04": "Try something simple: a fruit basket, good wine. She should appreciate the gesture. Talk to Bastian. I'm sure he can arrange something besides wine.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_Yes_15_05": "Thanks Viktor, you helped me a lot.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_Yes_03_06": "No problem. Good luck with that. And don't worry, I won't tell Martha about your plans.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_15_01": "It's not about me. Lutz is back.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_03_02": "Marvin, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to get involved in this. Do you even know what that man did to her?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_15_03": "Yeah, I managed to get that out of him. Now he wants to fix his mistakes.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_03_04": "In that case, he should come here himself instead of using you.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_03_05": "I'm sorry Marvin, but I can't help you this time.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_15_06": "I see what you mean. I'm sorry to have bothered you.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ213_No_03_07": "Oh, no problem. You know how Martha is, I don't want to see her mad for another couple of weeks.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_GiantBug_15_01": "What does the damage done by the field raiders look like?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_GiantBug_03_02": "Well, it depends on what plants they were feeding on.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_GiantBug_15_03": "Suppose on the vine.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_GiantBug_03_04": "Hmm, Field Raiders, if given the choice, tend to prefer all sorts of grains, so vines should be rather safe.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_GiantBug_03_05": "Why do you ask? Are you starting a vineyard and want to know what to watch out for?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_Yes_15_01": "I've been dreaming about this for a long time. As I listened to stories about the famous Archolos grapes, I imagined myself growing them and then making wine from them!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_Yes_03_02": "Don't be silly! The winemakers here are so well established that a pawn like you will only cause general amusement!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_Yes_03_03": "If it were me running a vineyard and I had something to be afraid of, I would be afraid of disgruntled employees.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_Yes_03_04": "And a disgruntled employee is one whose work goes to waste, or who has to deal with problems that are not of their own making.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_15_01": "I heard something was bothering you.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_03_02": "None of your business, Marvin. Seems to me you have other things to do than stick your nose in things that aren't yours.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_15_03": "I talked to Bastian. This whole situation with Martha and Lutz...",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_03_04": "Damn! Another one. Lutz this, Lutz that. Lutz is the best. Lutz did it. Piss off, Marvin, or I'll punch you in the face.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_Next_15_01": "So are you gonna tell me what this is all about?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_Next_03_02": "Lutz is getting on my nerves. Ever since he arrived, the whole village has been talking about him and how great he is.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_Next_03_03": "I've lived here with them all my life. I work. I help out whenever anybody needs anything. But so what? I can't count on a little interest.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_Fight_15_01": "Try your luck!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_Calm_15_01": "Easy there buddy, I wanted to check, just to make sure everything was ok.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Problem_Calm_03_02": "I'm sorry, Marvin. I didn't mean to offend you.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_AfterFistFight_15_01": "Have you cooled off?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_AfterFistFight_03_02": "My face... A beautiful blow, by the way.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_AfterFistFight_03_03": "Yeah, I'm... I'm a little better now...",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_15_01": "Are you jealous?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_03_02": "Just so you know. Bloody jealous. And this thing with Martha.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_15_03": "Wait a minute. I think I'm beginning to understand. You're jealous of her! Not Lutz.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_15_04": "Still waters run deep!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_03_05": "Eh...",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_15_06": "I won't tell them anything, be calm.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_03_07": "Thanks, I don't want to cause any more problems for the village.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_15_08": "And that's how I remember Viktor. Don't worry, everything will work out.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Jealous_03_09": "Let's hope it's as you say.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_Description": "Listen to me carefully.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_15_01": "Listen to me carefully. You want to get rid of Lutz and get Martha?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_03_02": "Of course!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_15_03": "Lutz wants to end it too, but he doesn't have the courage to tell Martha. Here's what we'll do, you go outside the inn and let him beat you up. Martha won't want to know him after that.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_03_04": "What do you want me to do?! Are you crazy? No way. I'm not going anywhere. If he doesn't have the balls to tell her he wants out of here, I will!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_03_05": "How did you even come up with something so stupid? You disappoint me, Marvin.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_15_06": "Viktor! Trust me!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_03_07": "Leave me alone!",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV2_15_01": "Lutz asked me to tell you he's waiting outside the inn.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV2_03_02": "For who? For me? Did you tell him anything?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV2_15_03": "I didn't even talk to him. I was supposed to give you a message, so I did.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV2_03_04": "All right, then. I'll go see what he wants again.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_15_08": "Good luck with Martha.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_03_09": "Now's my chance. As they say - a man doesn't know what he wants until he loses it.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_15_01": "Are you all right?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_03_02": "He shook my bones pretty good, but nothing serious. What's wrong with him all of a sudden?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_15_03": "Who knows. Anyway, Martha told him to get out. Looks like we won't be seeing Lutz in Silbach anytime soon.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_03_04": "He doesn't belong here. Still, I wish him to find a place for himself in this world.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_15_05": "Good old Viktor is back.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_03_06": "I will have to apologize to everyone for my behavior.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_LutzGone_15_07": "I think they won't hold grudges. Especially since Lutz and Martha won't be arguing all day.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Sorry_15_01": "I wanted to apologize to you...",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Sorry_03_02": "No problem. All's well that ends well. In fact, I even feel sorry for Lutz. On the other hand, I've never seen anyone run that fast.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_03_01": "Marvin, how are you? You look different... Is something wrong?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_No_15_01": "I'd rather not talk about it.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_No_03_02": "Okay, I understand, I won't bother you. Let me know if you change your mind.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_Yes_15_01": "Jorn is dead, and I nearly suffered the same fate.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_Yes_03_02": "By Adanos... I don't know what to say... I was sure you'd find him eventually.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_Yes_03_03": "I hope you can catch the person who is responsible for this.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Chapter5Hello_Yes_03_04": "If you need anything let me know.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_15_01": "What are you doing here? Guarding the warehouse?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_03_02": "Someone had to after what happened to Gabrien, and somehow Albyn chose me.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_03_03": "I won't say that I am complaining. I am outdoors most of the day and just observe what the whole of Silbach is living on.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_03_04": "Speaking of which, tell me, what do you think about this whole orc thing? Ramsey keeps saying it's just rumors, but the villagers are getting more and more concerned.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_Next_03_01": "Thanks for telling me about it. I'll have to talk to Thorsten about rearming our guards and farmers.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_Relax_15_01": "Rest assured, there are no orcs on Archolos.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_Relax_03_02": "Good to know, that's all we'd need on Archolos... Thanks for the information.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_Some_15_01": "I don't want to worry you, but more orc patrols are appearing on Archolos.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_Some_03_02": "Damn, I knew there had to be something to these rumors... but why didn't anyone tell us about it? Let me guess, they probably don't want everyone running into town in a panic.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_WeWon_15_01": "The orcs took Archolos as their target, but we were able to repel them. Or at least their first wave.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_WeWon_03_02": "You say you took part in this? Damn, you got guts, man! I've heard of many a soldier running from the battlefield at the sight of them...",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Help_15_01": "I am preparing for a dangerous mission and will need equipment.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Help_03_02": "It reminds me of the time when you just arrived in the village and didn't even have a few gold pieces on you.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Help_03_03": "Here, this should help a little.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Help_15_04": "Thanks a lot, Viktor.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Help_03_05": "In a different time I'd be happy to help you, but this situation with the orcs... I can't just take stuff out of our warehouse.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Help_15_06": "Sure, it's understandable.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_15_01": "Have you ever taken care of a dog?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_03_02": "I've always liked animals, but unfortunately never had a dog. Why do you ask?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_15_03": "Listen, a while back I took in a dog in the city. I'm going on an expedition and I'd like someone I trust to take care of him. Would you be willing?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_03_04": "Are you still asking? Of course I want to! Since I'm standing guard here anyway, it would be nice to have some friend to guard together.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_Goodbye_15_01": "I have to say goodbye to him and I'll bring him to Silbach.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_Goodbye_03_02": "Relax, we'll take good care of him here.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q505_Dog_Goodbye_15_03": "I have no concerns about that, thanks.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_08": "Sometimes we had a problem with a group of drunks, sometimes an animal got loose in the village, but a kidnapping? We haven't been through that yet.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_09": "I hope your brother is found safe and sound.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_07": "Not everyone looks upon you with a favorable eye, but you're safe here at the inn. You can rest easy.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_06": "It's a little tense, but believe me, Helmud's charcoal burners can be more problematic than you. Especially when they've had a drink.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_01": "Sorry, I'll talk to you later. I have to get back to work before Martha sees me slacking off.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_02": "Since Hendrik's death, the Elder has recruited sentries, but in my opinion that's not enough.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_03": "We could use some real flesh and blood guards.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_04": "Sometimes I think about getting away from here. I'd like to see the world or at least explore this island.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_05": "Life is too short to spend it cleaning pints and scrubbing floors.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_10": "The Beast is dead and we should all breathe a sigh of relief, but... something is bothering me.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_11": "Strange noises, neither animal nor human, are constantly coming from the forest.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_13": "It's the same here, but I see things have changed for you.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_14": "You look pretty good in that uniform, friend.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_15": "I see you've made friends with the mercenaries of Araxos...",
  "DIA_Viktor_Ambient_03_16": "Your choice, but people say that most of them are just plain thugs in nice clothes.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Pay_15_01": "What happens if I commit a crime?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Pay_12_02": "Fines for breaking the law in our village are dealt with by Albyn. He is the representative of the law by the grace of Sir Ramsey and the acquiescence of Captain Roderich.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Pay_12_03": "Fines must be also paid in the village for any crime committed in the surrounding vineyards, farms or fishing settlements.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Pay_12_04": "This arrangement suits everyone. Roderich has less work to do in town, Ramsey gets a share of every fine, and the farmers don't have to stand in line at the barracks.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Somethingelse_talklater_Choice": "Could we postpone the conversation until later?",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_MIL_Choice": "That's what reason dictates.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Brother_Choice": "Maybe they can help me find my brother.",
  "DIA_Viktor_Q205_Viktor_Long_Visual_Choice": "What did those guards look like?",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ225_GiantBug_Yes_Choice": "I've been dreaming about this for a long time.",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV2_Choice": "(Don't let Viktor know about the plan)",
  "DIA_Viktor_SQ410_Decision_EndingV1_Choice": "(Let Viktor know about the plan)",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_WeWon_Choice": "The orcs have been repulsed...",
  "DIA_Viktor_Warehouse_Some_Choice": "More orc patrols are appearing on Archolos..."
