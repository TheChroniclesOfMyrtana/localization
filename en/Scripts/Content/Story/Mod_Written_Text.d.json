	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Alchemy_5": "Along with learning the next levels, master passes on the knowledge of healing potions, but acquiring more complex recipes is up to the apprentice.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Alchemy_6": "An experienced alchemist can also extract plant seeds from the game he has hunted and convert them into healing potions. However, no temporary or permanent potion has yet been produced through the seeds.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Alchemy_7": "Although permanent potions seem to be the most powerful, don't forget about temporary potions - they come from different ingredients, so they don't use up the alchemist's precious resources, and their effects are really powerful!",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Bow_1": "First, to use a bow, the hunter should develop his dexterity, while to wield a crossbow, strength will be required.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Bow_2": "Despite the difference in predispositions required to wield these weapons, each marksman can increase the damage dealt by his weapon by developing his dexterity. Dexterity is what influences the complex process of preparing the projectiles for firing and how much damage they will do in the end.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Bow_3": "However, this should not be confused with shooting skills - the skill with a bow or crossbow will primarily determine the accuracy and speed of the shots. A master will fire many more projectiles at a time, while hitting targets much farther away from himself.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Bow_4": "Why crossbows are so popular? You should pay attention to the base power of the projectile fired from a crossbow. It is much greater than that of a bow. Due to the construction of the bolt and the speed at which it moves, it is extremely effective against heavily armored opponents.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Bow_5": "An often overlooked advantage of crossbows is their ability for a balanced development - a good crossbowman is someone who is strong enough to wield massive crossbows, but also skillful enough to inflict a lot of damage with them.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Bow_6": "Both bows and crossbows, even in the hands of novice marksmen, are capable of knocking a man down without killing him on the spot. However, if you need to make sure your enemy doesn't get up, you should carry even the simplest of melee weapons.",

	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Craft_2": "Because they are made perfectly to one's body proportions, they almost always require the user to have less strength or dexterity to wield them effectively.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Craft_3": "In order to begin crafting your own weapons, you must first decide whether you want to pursue bowmaking, which involves the crafting of both bows and crossbows, or perhaps practice blacksmithing, which specializes in all things related to melee weapons. Once you've decided, find the right teacher - no book can replace practice under the guidance of an experienced master.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Craft_4": "Learning can be divided into three stages - beginner, advanced and master. With each one, craftsman can master more complex diagrams and craft them on the bowyer's table or anvil respectively.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Craft_5": "Recipes can usually be purchased from other blacksmiths and bowyers. Most weapons require various hunting trophies, such as skins, fangs or claws of specific beasts. To reduce costs, it is a good idea to develop hunting skills yourself.",
	"WrittenText_Bookstand_Craft_6": "To produce ranged weapons, you will always need proper wood, bowstrings and, for the finer works, lizard tongues. Basic melee weapons require pure iron, while steel and magic ore one's will also need coal and magic ore nuggets respectively.",

	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Bat_2": "The inhabitants of towns and villages alike often tell tales of mysterious creatures from the depths of sewers or abandoned caves. Fear is a powerful thing, so the local populace likes to spin unbelievable tales of demons that feed on the blood of the innocent. The truth is quite different. Some caves and unvisited parts of city sewers are inhabited by bats.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Bat_3": "These oversized nocturnal creatures can fly, and since they are equipped with fangs and claws, they don't hesitate to use them against their prey. In fact, it's best not to wake them at all, as they sleep for days. A skilled hunter will simply sneak past them. In the event of a clash, these creatures are particularly vulnerable to projectiles. A skilled mage can also knock them down with a gust of wind'.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Bear_1": "Bears, despite appearances, could be written about at great length. As dangerous as they are, they are also easy to avoid or even kill, depending on your hunting skills. Bears are obviously huge and very strong. They inhabit forests and small caves. Many scholars have wondered if the bear is somehow related to the dogs and wolves we all know, but this theory has largely collapsed for lack of meaningful evidence.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Bear_2": "There is, however, a belief among friends in academia that a breakthrough in the unraveling of the creature's origins is yet to come. Scientific and naturalistic meanderings aside, the bear, despite its strength, is vulnerable to sword or axe blows. In case of an encounter, the best solution is to skillfully dodge the animal's slow attacks and quickly counterattack with a series of slashes'.",

He felt it coming back to life briefly, its leaves gently rippling in the wind. But as soon as the boy opened his eyes, the blue glow in his hands disappeared, and the plant subsided.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_CircleOfLife_2": "Master Larius watched Ezran from a distance. His determination impressed him greatly, but it also brought him concern. Larius approached Ezran and embraced him as a caring father would embrace his son.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_CircleOfLife_3": "They left the monastery and headed west through a dense grove. Larius showed Ezran the beauty of nature. He showed him the clumps of river myrtle and the violets growing in the groves. He showed him how a little molerat took its first steps, only to become food for the she-wolf and her cubs.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_CircleOfLife_4": "Thus, Ezran understood what the Circle of Life was. He took the plant out of the bundle. It was almost all withered except for one fruit, which still resisted the inevitable. He picked the fruit and buried it gently in the ground. A moment later, he felt the first drop of spring rain on his forehead and smiled slightly.",

It wasn't the usual stench of rotten fish in the market or tanned hides, but the nostril-piercing, lingering stench of charred human flesh. I could smell it in the streets, in the houses, even on the steps of the church.",

	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_CityOnFire_01_5": "And then, when for a moment the wind blew away the flames already reaching the Old Town, I saw him standing on the battlements. I saw Mandes. A murderer with the dying city at his feet. In a daring gesture of victory, he held his torch high and admired his work of destruction. By Innos, if I carried the crossbow, that monster would have gotten what he deserved.",

While it wasn't that long ago that I was looking for a reason to bust that shithead Adelard and his ragged band, today they stood shoulder to shoulder with us. After long hours of fighting the elements, together we managed to put out the flames and the Southerners were either killed or captured. Their leader, however, vanished without a trace.",

	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_CityOnFire_02_4": "Others argued that they had brought him justice themselves, but had 'forgotten' where they had left the body. Then there were those who brought me random Southerners, demanding carts filled to the brim with gold for them.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_CityOnFire_02_5": "Whatever the fate of Mandes, his words, like the poison of a bloodfly, had become deeply embedded in the blood of his people. As my men led the captured Southerners to the scaffold, I saw in their eyes neither fear nor regret, but anger - pure, fiery anger. I do not know where, when or how, but sooner or later these barbarians will take up arms again, and this time we must be ready for it.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Crab_1": "Among the nobility, interest in maritime culture has been flourishing for some time. Rich gentlemen and their ladies spend their leisure time on the beaches. However, habits brought from the cities are the cause of numerous mishaps and accidents. The best example is a close encounter with crabs. These oversized arthropods are covered with a thick shell. They are territorial.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Crab_2": "They do not like to be disturbed. This is especially true for individuals during the mating season. A cooperating male crab is very aggressive. Not knowing what they are doing, citizens of cities approach busy crustaceans, after which they end up with broken arms, legs and numerous bruises. Either way, in the event of a close encounter with a crab, a blow with a club or a stream of magic is enough to kill them'.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Crossbows_1": "The man stepped out of the tent and stretched his legs. Feeling a breeze of fresh air, he hurriedly wrapped himself in his fur and took a sip of wine. He approached the pond and shaved his beard properly. After all, he had been a lieutenant since yesterday. The trenches were ready.",

	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Crossbows_5": "The boy felt something pierce his chest. Something cold and hard. He didn't even have a moment to think about what it was, from where, and for what. But he was glad that it was over. He fell into the trench dug below and ceased to feel anything at all.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Dragons_1": "Many people believe that dragons belong only to the world of bedtime stories told to naughty children. But are these winged beasts really nothing more than the product of human imagination? There is some evidence to cast doubt on this claim.",

However, this is impossible to confirm in any way, due to the apparent lack of irrefutable evidence for the existence of these large winged reptiles.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_FireLizzard_3": "Currently, the genesis of fire lizards is thought to be changes resulting from an ordinary lizard's exposure to harsh environmental conditions. The fire lizard has simply developed an additional line of defense.",

It is not know, however, how to extract a substance that causes the 'fire breathing'. Nonetheless, an extreme caution is advised when confronting them. The best way to keep fire lizards at bay is to finish them off with a scroll of the wind fist.",

They are usually found around forest streams. They usually live in groups of several individuals, though they are also found alone. Unlike goblins, frogmen are taller than humans.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Frogman_2": "They resemble somewhat shrunken, amphibian-like orcs rather than the hated by all goblins. Interestingly, frogmen are not limited to simple weapons such as maces. More and more often you can come across individuals using small pebble slingshots. While even a strong blow can be blocked, a stone shot from a slingshot is not so easy to see, let alone reflect. Ultimately, however, despite their strength and size, frogmen are not sturdy creatures, and a good hit with a sword or axe can take them down'.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_Light_1": "Before the stars hung in the sky, and the mountains and the seas rose from the vast abysses of the world, an infinite darkness reigned over all existence, and its master was Beliar, the Deceiver and the Wicked One.

The burning brightness of his blade melted the darkest hearts, and brought straying men back to the path of light. But then the Dark One summoned the Beast to the world, who poisoned people's hearts again and darkness hung over the sky. But the Lord of Light did not leave man in his hour of need and he raised above the clouds a shield of light, which to this day brings hope to the afflicted.",
	"WrittenText_BookStand_Lore_LondramBow_1": "Although the bow as a weapon and a hunting tool has been around since the dawn of time, its heyday was during the reign of Volfzack, the first ruler of Archolos. Made famous on Londram, one of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, the long bow, later known as the 'Londram bow', took a heavy toll on the light-armed warriors of the 'Wolf'. The initial success of Volfzack's campaign was met with heavy losses, and the ruler was ultimately forced to leave empty handed.",

They are said to be unrivalled in the use of the bow, because they begin training their arm muscles at an early age. Others, a little out of spite, a little out of jealousy, say that the islanders are so attached to their bows that they sleep with them more often than with their wives. Whether you believe these stories or not, the truth is that you won't find better shooters anywhere in the world than Londramians",

I have spent enough time in my workshop. It is time to go out into the world and share what I have accomplished so far.

We were leading an expedition deep into the forest to study the local flora for useful herbalists.",

However, a Troll can be tricked quite easily. Due to its size, the creature is slow, which is something to take advantage of in a fight.

Everything has a cause, so we seek the ultimate first cause in Adanos. And finally, we see that everything decays, changes, transforms. Could something that decays be a cause for itself?

Then the Gracious One awoke the hearts from stone and angered the sea, which separated the grain from the chaff, surrounding the faithful with a soothing sheet of infinite blue.",
	"WrittenText_AboutNordmar_1": "Far to the north of Myrtana's borderlands, stand the snow-capped peaks of Nordmar - a frozen, inaccessible land, home to a proud warrior people. There is a reason they are called that, as for centuries they have been the target of invasions by the Orc tribes of the vast Northern Plains.",
	"WrittenText_AboutNordmar_2": "Though Nordmar itself is a cold land, its people have hot blood in their veins, and so they prefer to solve any problem with their fists, sword or axe. No wonder - their life consists of constant fighting with enemies or the forces of nature.",

	"WrittenText_AboutNordmar_4": "From an early age, Nordmarian boys are taught the art of survival. When they reach adulthood, as a test of their manhood, their fathers send them into the wilderness to retrieve a shadowbeast's horn. Adolescent women, on the other hand, are taught by their mothers the craft and care of the home in order to fulfill their future duty as good wives and mothers.",
	"WrittenText_AboutVarrant_1": "A true merchant will not learn his trade at village fairs and festivals, pushing pendants and trinkets to the public for half a price. The lesson after which, dear reader, you will be able to call yourself a gold-master of coinage, will be given you only by the Scarlet Road, stretching for many miles from Southern Myrtana to Middle Varrant.",
	"WrittenText_AboutVarrant_2": "It is said that the name of this southern-scorched route derives from the goods sold along it, such as crimson wines from Montilia, rubies mined from the mines of Vallaros, and exotic, spicy spices from the Saffron Oasis. Others argue that the scarlet refers to the blood that was bought by the fairs slaughtered along the trail.",
	"WrittenText_AboutVarrant_3": "Despite the ongoing war and civil unrest, the Scarlet Route area is full of challenges and surprises, awaiting amateur and experienced traders alike. While I could write the story of my life and how I came to my fortune in the pages of this book, I will not. No amount of theory can replace the valuable practice you will gain by traveling from market to market, learning local customs, and making promising contacts.",
	"WrittenText_DrivingForce_1": "Whether you are a simple merchant or a knowledgeable scientist, you have surely noticed that the world is governed by a predetermined order. Farmers in the fields bend their necks in the scorching sun of the day, and weary travelers find their way home thanks to the moon's light at night. The abundant rains make plants grow faster, and the ore exposed to fire can be shaped on the anvil at will over time.",
	"WrittenText_DrivingForce_2": "Countless treatises have been written trying to explain what this unknown force is that sets the world and all its elements in motion. Although many awe-inspiring speculations have been made on the subject, the theory closest to the truth is that this influence comes from the heavens, where Innos has his seat.",
	"WrittenText_DrivingForce_3": "It is he who, like a skilled miller, turns the wheel of life day after day, pushing the discs of the sun and moon over the sky, creating rain clouds and stoking the fires in the hearths.",
	"WrittenText_DrivingForce_4": "While it would be heartening to simple hearts and minds to accept the position that Innos is a personified entity, scholars should treat him purely metaphorically, as a kind of Causal Power that gives momentum to the world and one that must be endlessly studied.",
	"WrittenText_DrivingForce_02_1": "Understanding Innos not as a personified god, but as an idea of causality, order of nature and perfection of action, people, occupying the lowest position in the spherical division of the world, should be considered adequately as the least perfect. Proof of this is the fact that we make mistakes. Innos, on the other hand, does not make mistakes at all, and if there is an exception to the rule, it is considered to be a widely understood and judgment-free 'divine will'.",
	"WrittenText_DrivingForce_02_2": "It should surprise no one, therefore, why the gates of heaven are sealed tight against man. Are we therefore destined to remain forever subject to the laws of a higher, incomprehensible force?",

The sun, which is the work of the Causal Power, warms the grapes through the summer, which can be harvested by the farmers in the fall. Then the man transforms the knowledge and kneads the grapes.

From numerous books and reports, however, we know that it is vast, stretching from the windswept plains of Nordmar in the north to the sun-baked wastelands of Varrant in the south. It is separated from the east by the blue surface of the Sea of Myrtana, and from the west by the Boundless Steppes stretching for hundreds of miles.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_01_2": "Politicians, for simplicity or to seek the King's approval, often refer to it as the largest political entity on it - the Kingdom of Myrtana. Scholars, on the other hand, prefer to use the name 'The Blessed Continent'.",

	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_02_1": "According to the few surviving sources, we know that the area of present-day Myrtana was once covered by dense forests where trolls, shadowbeasts and much older beasts, forgotten by time, reigned. One day, however, a creature unknown to these lands appeared within their borders. It was a man. In the midst of unspoiled forests and wilderness, huts sprang up one after another like mushrooms, which with time began to grow into wooden settlements, then villages, and finally brick cities.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_02_2": "While the evidence is clear that the first people to arrive on the east coast of the continent were the Myrtanians, they were soon joined by two other groups.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_02_3": "The first, wandering for weeks through the inhospitable southern wilderness, established the settlement of Varrant in the An'hita River basin. The second group took the northern route along the ridge of the Ash Mountains, which led them to a valley battered by the freezing winds. There they established the stronghold of Fjellborg, the capital of present day Nordmar.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_02_4": "Although the members of each culture share many similarities, the lands in which they made their homes, the customs they followed, and the faith to which they gave their hearts have all conditioned their sovereignty over the years.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_03_1": "According to a report by Royal Scribe Sevinus, native Myrtanians make up a second part of the total population of the known part of the continent. However, this is not surprising. For the Kingdom of Myrtana, in its current dimension, is the beating heart of human civilization, and its kings, like good shepherds, 'tirelessly carry the light to people all over the world'.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_03_2": "How, then, in the proximity of Myrtana, did the Varrantians and Nordmarians manage to preserve their cultural identity? The answer lies in geography. For a single trade route leads from Myrtana to Varrant, situated between Ruby Bay to the south and the slopes of the Ash Mountains to the north.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_03_3": "Nordmar, on the other hand, is a valley surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges that naturally separate the land from the influence of the outside world.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_03_4": "The spirit of Varrantians and Nordmarians is extremely difficult to break. Living in the shadow of orc bands of the Northern Plains, the people of Nordmar must always remain vigilant to defend their homes. The Varrantians have never had enough natural resources themselves, so they learned to take from others. Both of these cultures are characterized by hardiness, which has no doubt helped them keep their integrity.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_04_1": "It is important to remember that the climate of both lands plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of the sovereignty of the cultures of Varrant and Nordmar. Because of the dry season that lasts nearly eight months in the Middle Varrant area, its inhabitants like to wear light jackets or leather capes and airy linen pants. The huts of the Varrantians often have no shutters or doors and are replaced by curtains stretched across the entire width of the hut, protecting the inhabitants from the sun and insects.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_04_2": "The people of Nordmar, on the other hand, are accustomed to wearing thick sheepskin coats, insulated pants and heavy coats to keep out the cold.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_04_3": "Unlike the inhabitants of Varrant and Myrtana, they live in houses made of hard-sawn logs covered with a thick layer of clay on the outside and animal skins.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_04_4": "The climate of Varrant and Nordmar also influenced the style of fighting preferred by the inhabitants of these countries. Clad in light, unrestrictive clothing, Varrants prefer to wield light one- or two-handed weapons such as seymites and javelins. The Nordmarians, on the other hand, tightly wrapped in several layers of clothing, have limited mobility, so they usually train to fight with straight, double-edged wedges or axes, valuing above all the power and momentum of their blows.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_05_1": "Faith in Innos, the patron saint of Myrtana, is being tested day by day in the face of the War with the Orcs, the plague plaguing the south of the Kingdom and the unrest in the streets of Vengard. And as the main religion on the continent wanes, other religions gain followers.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_05_2": "Although the origins of the belief in Beliar in Varrant are shrouded in mystery, the Book of Fire speaks of four Black Mages who instilled a hatred for Innos into the people of this land. Scholars, on the other hand, argue that the Lord of Death originated in the hearts of the people as an idea to counterbalance the Myrtanians, who were leading the continent.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_05_3": "It is worth noting, however, that this religion promotes the cult of strength and the power of the strong over the weak, which in turn fits perfectly with the plundering nature of the Varrantians.",
	"WrittenText_BlessedContinent_05_4": "The people of Nordmar, on the other hand, are not a people of deep faith. Day after day they struggle against nature, which usually provides them with generous harvests, and they have long since learned to trust their own abilities. There are, however, those who make symbolic offerings, whether out of tradition or precaution, to unspecified nature deities - at the edges of forests, in rushing streams and on snowy mountain slopes.",
	"WrittenText_WolfSonVardhal_01_1": "Despite a pack of wolves following our trail, we made it to the gates of Vardhal without much difficulty. Barthos spoke the truth about the size of this fortress. Before fire and time turned it to ruins, it must have been impressive!",

We would have dealt with them long ago if Ioris hadn't been sitting with her nose in those useless books! The animals bit Kerran, but to my eye he'll lick it up. He's a tough guy.",
	"WrittenText_WolfSonVardhal_02_2": "In the morning, Sevinus returned and brought the rest of the tools for building the footbridge to the other side of the ravine. He also brought something like a key that will help us open the gates to the fortress. I wonder how he plans to do that. Thanks to Adanos for having some of that wine left. I feel like I'll still need it.",

	"WrittenText_WolfSonVardhal_03_2": "In them, I walked down a dark hallway toward the light. But with each step I took further, the light got further and further away.

The sky was pouring down day by day, night by night. And on this sorrowful hour, a Foregin King has arrived at the shore with a hundred of his men, armed as for war. He was a greedy and haughty man, and the life of others meant as much as the lives of meatbugs he crushed under his feet.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachLegend_01_2": "And so the King of Slaves got off his crimson boat over the heads of his servants. He breathed heavily, for he was a man of grand posture. He looked around on the left and right, hoping to see a song-worthy battle.",

The Proud Sovereign looked at the gifts laid before him, snorted with contempt, and tossed them away with his fat hand. He demanded that each of the younglings bring him the greatest treasure of this land, and if he won’t be happy of them, he promised that the darkness of Morgrad itself shall fall upon them.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachLegend_02_1": "The first youngling approached the Foregin King, and with trembling hands he offered him a necklace made of polished amber. The Sovereign climbed down his slaves like a fat molerat from his den. He then yanked the necklace from the boy’s hands and tried to put it through his head. But with the first attempt, the trinket broke and ambers fell one after another into the sand. The Wrathful One grabbed the boy in half and choked him to death with the strap left in his hands.",

The Terrible One then angered greatly at the boy, grabbed him by his throat, and shook, nearly choking the whole life out of him.

In the company of this beverage, countless treaties were signed, kings crowned and wars declared. Others would say that it is gold. After all, due to merchant contracts, the island is now called ‘Vengard of the East’. For me, however, that treasure has always been silver.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_01_2": "Legends tell that many years before robbers, traders and lords tore apart the goods of this island, mountain caves were teeming with an immense source of silver. Eventually, the greed of some foreign king led to a landslide,",

	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_01_4": "In such a way, people started to name it ‘Silver Creek’, and in its basin, the village of Silbach was built.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_01_5": "Old merchant documents from that period confirm that the village was the place for unloading silver. There was so much of this raw material around, that people would call Silbach the ‘Silver Court’. Raftsmen would carry immeasurable amounts of silver ore to the town and to the mouth of the river. It was silver that made Silbach flourish and turned it into one of the key transit points on Archolos.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_02_1": "The earliest records about Silbach suggest that the village could be built in the period following the arrival of Maximus III, king of Myrtana. According to oral traditions, however, the settlement existed already before the time of the coming of ‘iron-clad warriors from beyond the great sea’. Presumably, Silbach was then nothing more than a bunch of huts which due to the flourishing trade grew to the size of a regular village.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_02_2": "After Maximus’s invasion, the town of Archolos was turned into a ruin, and its reconstruction to a Myrtanian-styled city lasted many years. At this time, Silbach, situated in the centre of the island, became the main trade point on the island.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_02_3": "Although due to the king's reforms, the old order was rooted out from the town, traditions found their way to flourish outside it. Despite being a part of the Kingdom of Myrtana, Silbach became a refuge for local habits.",

The farmer claimed that villagers learnt how to tame the forces of nature with their hard work. The mage, however, believed that the gratitude belongs to Adanos who in his generosity regularly brings rain upon the fields. The alchemist, on the other hand, stated that the volcanic soils increase the growth of crops.",

From the most honoured people of Silbach, he chose the man whom he gave the noble title and the village together with the areas around it. The price for such a gift, however, was meant to be a boundless service to the crown.",

On the first day of his governance, he visited the church in the town where he swore service to Archolos and Myrtana. His rule was a constant struggle for keeping the balance between the needs of townsfolk and villagers.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_04_3": "One summer, William was taken by the plague which broke out on the island. His son, Ramsey, was then but a youngling, so he remained under the custody of his mother. Thus, Lady Aldona, also called an ‘Iron Lady’, took control over Silbach, and no ruler was ever close to her grandeur and determination.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_04_4": "Despite the governor's orders, Aldona built a large manor in Silbach, renewed the chapel of Adanos, and erected a watermill solely for villagers. For this and other reasons, she was brought to the town hall to explain herself. But  ‘whenever Lady Aldona spoke, the governor and his lapdogs looked beside her like a bunch of scared little rats’.",
	"WrittenText_SilbachBackstory_05_1": "Lady Aldona ruled Silbach wisely, and many people speak highly of her even today. No lord before her had enough courage to stand in opposition to governors and fight for the good of the people of Silbach.

	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_02_1": "The first and most obvious point of my trip was the city. The truth was told by sailors about the size of this agglomeration. It is huge! Its countless streets, passageways, arcades and overpasses are sure to make you dizzy.",
	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_02_2": "Whether you've been here for a while or not, I advise you to buy Cartographer's Ludwig's city map, with key directional points marked on it. If you still get lost, ask any of the Araxos Merchant's Guild runners for directions. They will lead you anywhere you want - of course, if you toss them a few coins beforehand.",

Once you've made your way through the throngs of workers and poor in the harbor, stop by the Siren's Wail for a pint of ale. Helga, the tavern's owner, may serve nasty beer, but she's also a treasure trove of gossip and information.",
	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_02_4": "The most important thing is to find a job. Even if it's carrying barrels of rotten fish, you have to work in this town. Otherwise, sooner or later you will end up on the street, and from there you will take a straight path to the Poorhouse. And believe me, you don't want to end up there.",
	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_03_1": "Prepare yourself, dear reader, for the inhabitants of this village to be only slightly nicer than a herd of angry scavengers! They will stare you down, spit at your feet and threaten with their fists - especially Gabrien. Day and night he guards some shed like a rabid dog guards a piece of rotten meat. I had the impression that he didn't beat my face in just because he didn't want to listen to the lamentations of the steward later on.",

He cares about his guests no matter who they are or where they come from. As long as they have something to pay for it. He helped me with the local drunkard Rik. If he hadn't done that, I'm sure I would have been in chains. If you can survive in Silbach, I give you my word, you will survive anywhere on this island!",

The fishermen there, former sailors of the Myrtanian fleet, live from day to day, practicing simple but honest crafts.",

If you have some time, sit by his campfire and listen to some stories. His friend Harold collects and sells various trinkets thrown ashore by the waves. Although most of that is junk, sometimes you can find a real beauty.",

On the other hand, I even understand him. Managing a farm operation is a big responsibility. Despite his sharp tongue, Bermar commands respect from people. Apparently he also maintains good relations with the merchant guild Araxos, whose mercenaries often visit the farm.",

They produce light and sweet wines, contrasting with the heavy, aromatic drinks of the competitor from the north. It was their liquors that appealed to me the most. The woman says she doesn't make much money from them and has to look for markets wherever she can. Her employees seem much nicer than the people in the north, and most importantly, they are also much more open to strangers.",
	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_07_1": "In the east of the island, just beyond the charcoal pile and a large lake, rises a mountain fortress called 'Wolf's Den' by the locals. It is said to be ruled by a burgrave who reclaimed it from its previous owner years ago. I tried to learn more about the history of this fortress, but the people I met nearby were silent and unwilling to talk. I had the impression that they were afraid of something.",
	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_07_2": "Although the fortress looked old at first sight, one could feel a certain majesty emanating from it - a reminder of past glory. The way through the gate was blocked by a stout sentry dressed in full armor from head to toe.",

	"WrittenText_ArcholosTravel_07_4": "Helmud, a builder who worked on the other side of the lake, told me that these warriors sometimes visited his outpost to see if the charcoal burners were doing their jobs properly. For what purpose? He would not say. He was reticent, just like the people of Wolf's Den. Or maybe he was just afraid of those  boneheads? If I were you, Reader, I would avoid this place by a wide margin.",

Unlike their counterparts in the city, they do not beg for donations for the Church, but try to be self-sufficient by planting herbs and vegetables.

The age when brothers and sisters would betray each other and all teachings of Adanos would be forgotten.",

And so the King of Myrtana signed a treaty, allowing the Wolf Sons to keep their dignity and the scraps of freedom. Many people sought refuge at our gates, and we, according to the Lord’s teachings, took them under our roof.",
	"WrittenText_ArcanumMarum_07_1": "With Maximus’ victory, the faith of Innos began to expand rapidly across Archolos. But people did not follow their dogmas willingly. It was instilled in them with force and fear by the king’s envoys. Following the prior’s advice, brothers Ladris, Arrian, Gordian, and Ordius set off to the four corners of the island to protect with a word and, if need be, with a deed, our stock from the wrath of the believers of Innos.",

Shortly after, armed men stepped into the temple, depraved our sacred place, and seized many of the faithful. Innos himself must have seen this evil, as he brought fire upon the town hall, whose flames could be quenched only by soothing drops of the spring rain.",
	"WrittenText_ArcanumMarum_08_1": "Many years after the death of Maximus, despite the hatred which still burned bright in people’s hearts, followers of Adanos and Innos learned how to live together in peace. When the servants of the God of Light took hold over the town, believers of the Lord of Order would crowd in villages, forests, and on the shore of the sea. With that, the process of restoration was fulfilled, and the balance on Archolos was preserved. As a sign of conciliation, we decided to lay foundations for the bridge meant to rejoin the monastery with the mainland.",

Supposing that Farkand's soldiers were behind the attack, Jarund responded with a firm and powerful strike against his brother's guardhouses. His warriors, however, had no difficulty in doing so, for they outnumbered their opponents in numbers, weapons, and training. Just days after the conflict began, Farkand was pushed back to the Silver River line.",

The king of the island, mindful of the wrongs Volfzack had once inflicted on his father, made high demands. In the event of victory over Jarund, he was to claim the throne of Archolos, which after his death would pass to his sons until the end of time.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_02_4": "Farkand found it difficult to agree to the Londramian king's ultimatum, risking both his authority and the future of the island. He knew, however, that if he did not, Jarund would prevail in this war and bury their father's dream of eternal peace.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_03_1": "With the onset of the Great Winter, the front line shifted slightly to the Northern Tract. Jarund, however, did not easily surrender to his brother. He was able to resist thanks to three companies of swarthy mercenaries he brought from the island of Glenwyr, north of Archolos.",

	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_03_3": "Deprived of supplies Jarund, however, still had enough reserves to successfully hold the siege for months. Farkand, on the other hand, though in control of the fields, was unable to exploit their riches due to the advancing winter.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_03_4": "When the outcome of the war seemed to be at a standstill, black smoke rose over the northern bay, and with it could be smelled the stench of burning wood. It was the Londramian fleet that was in flames. The scouts, however, did not see the wolf banners of the long-awaited Korvan, but the pennants of Myrtana's overseas king Maximus III the Conqueror.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_04_1": "The first blow of the Myrtanian hammer fell on the small coast in the north of the island, manned by Jarund's forces. It was there that one of the bloodiest battles of the war took place between the vanguard of the royal army and the mercenaries of Glenwyr. Despite the element of surprise and overwhelming odds on the Myrtanians' side, Jarund's men held off waves of royal paladins all day until the last defender was dead. The Northern Tract was then opened to Maximus.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_04_2": "Having destroyed Londram's fleet, Farkand knew that sooner or later he would have to face an overseas force. He also knew that he could not defeat the Myrtanian army in the open field. So he decided to resort to trickery and lured Lord Ottmar's contingent to the Crow's Pass, a small rocky passage to the south. The moment the paladins and royal guardsmen were in the gorge, Farkand's scouts set off a trap, dropping an avalanche on the invaders. Many noble paladins then perished under the boulders and in the basin below. Despite high hopes, this move did not stop Ottmar from pushing Farkand further south.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_05_1": "While the Myrtanian contingent pushed the enemy towards the Silver River, the 'Army North' commanded by the king himself besieged the city. Jarund suspected that Archolos would not hold out for long, so he fled through the sewers with his most loyal men. He hoped that the people left behind would delay the city's agony and give him time to prepare a counterattack. However, the volunteers, without a leader, were slaughtered by Myrtanians.",

Farkand, alone and wounded, died at the hands of the knights. With the capturing of the city and the crushing of resistance in the south, the Myrtanians paved the way to the ancient fortress of Vardhal.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_06_1": "The frost held for many months. Longer than any other in the memory of the people of Archolos. Winter was followed by spring, but as if in defiance of the order of nature, not a sprout grew from the ground strewn with corpses and soaked with blood. It was as if it itself knew that the worst was yet to come.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_06_2": "And it was not wrong. For Maximus' and Jarund's soldiers were preparing for the biggest battle of the war. While Jarund was regrouping the remnants of his troops in the mountain citadel in the east, Maximus, having crushed the resistance in the south and captured the city, launched a full force assault on the fortress of Vardhal.",
	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_06_3": "Corpses were strewn thickly on both sides, and arrows and projectiles from ballistas and catapults constantly pierced the sky. Although the Myrtanians outnumbered the defenders in numbers and equipment, the defenders had excellent conditions to withstand even a siege of several years. The walls of Vardhal were thick and high, a narrow stone bridge led to the gate, and each tower had a stone-throwing mangonel. All it would have taken was for Vardec, commander of the Wolf Sons, to wait patiently for relief from the east, and Jarund would have had victory in hand.",

	"WrittenText_BrothersWar_07_3": "Maximus therefore sent for the mage Wirgilio, who had stood by his side since campaign started. He promised the king victory over the pagans provided that his soldiers proved worthy servants of the God of Fire. Maximus gave the orders.",

When they reached its gates, the heavens lit up with a blood-red glow and the clouds spat out living fire, a fiery rain fell upon the fortress. Neither the steel of the armour nor the stone walls could resist it. It did not spare anyone.",

It is said that, horrified by the extent of the destruction, Maximus fell to his knees, clutching a statue of Innos in his hands. It was at that moment that the boastful king was said to have calmed down in the face of the power of the Fire God and fully offered Archolos to his protection.",

	"WrittenText_AgeOfLife_1": "When in a primordial world, lands and waters found its place, the power of creation gave birth to plants and animals. As on the order of the fire element, still rising mountains trembled, and spit flames which enriched dead soil. Then, river basins became covered with grass, and mountain valleys with forests.",

It was then that the gates of the stronghold burst open and the barbarians attacked. However, Innos did not abandon his children. A fiery glow lit the blackened sky, bringing a ball of fire to the battlefield, burning the traitors and followers of Ahalt to the ground. The battle was won.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_03_1": "People saw Rhobar as the divine anointed, and crowned him the first king of Myrtana, a country formed from the confederation of tribes converted to the faith of Innos. The new ruler knew that it was faith which bound the hearts of men together in one common purpose. For this reason, he formed a group of wise men - people with the power granted by the Lord himself.

It is believed that his passion for adventure gave birth to his urge to travel.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_05_2": "However, this was no mere whim of yet another noble, but a deliberate policy to expand borders of Myrtana. Domenico poured a large part of his treasury into the construction of a huge fleet which, according to its captains, was meant to ‘touch the horizon’.",

	"WrittenText_InnosWill_06_4": "Albrecht was the first king of Myrtana to recognize the value of the magic ore mined on the island of Khorinis. Its strength and magical properties were to give his army an advantage. However, not many smiths could shape the ore, so the ruler allocated it only to the needs of the paladins.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_07_1": "King Albrecht, having no heir, passed the crown to his nephew, Maximus. The young ruler received from his uncle a strong and prosperous kingdom. Or so it seemed.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_07_2": "As shipping grew, the aristocracy craved rights to new colonies, their own armies, and wider freedoms beyond the mainland Myrtana. They incited the people against the king, but he consistently nipped their claims in the bud.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_07_3": "Maximus had no easy nut to crack. There were plenty of advisors at Vengard's court, but they only looked at things from a self-interested perspective.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_07_4": "The King heard the advice of each, but only listened to the Archmage of Fire, Ferrus.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_07_5": "The priest said that nothing unites people like a common enemy, so he proposed that the king organize an expedition to the lands in the east, where the torch of Innos had not yet reached. He assigned his most faithful disciple, Wirgilio, to assist him in this noble work.",

	"WrittenText_InnosWill_08_1": "After two weeks of travel, Maximus’ forces landed on the island of Archolos, right in the middle of the bloody conflict later known as the War of the Two Brothers. Following the death of Volfzack, the first ruler of the land, his two sons Jarund and Farkand were at each other's throats, shedding the blood of thousands within a year.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_08_2": "The first Myrtanian attack fell on the northwestern coast of the island. Welcomed by the rain of arrows, paladins clashed with hosts of Glenwyr. At the same time, the fleet blockaded the harbor, and from the west, troops advanced up the Silver River.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_08_3": "Although warriors of Archolos were many, Myrtanians had better equipment. Armed with swords of magic ore paladins obliterated barbarian hosts. They were supported by the famous crossbow battalion of Captain Carrizo.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_08_4": "During the campaign, Maximus proved his tactical genius by dividing his army into three groups and effectively coordinating their actions. When the king eliminated Farkand's forces, archmage Wirgilio was the one who sealed Myrtana's victory. Inspired by the words of Innos himself, he brought a rain of fire upon the fortress of Vardhal, Jarund's main point of resistance.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_09_1": "After his victory on Archolos, Maximus was criticised by aristocracy. Many considered the expedition to be a whim of a young king who had become overwhelmed by his duties at home. The conquest itself was a sign of barbarism. In retrospect, Maximus could not have made a better decision.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_09_2": "The intervention on Archolos not only converted the inhabitants to the faith in Innos, but also developed them civilizationally. Mediocre administration was replaced by the tried and tested Myrtanian system, and the moribund economy was revived by trade routes.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_09_3": "Within less than a year Maximus III, called the Conqueror, had colonized the neighboring island of Londram and established outposts on distant Contira. With the conquest of nearly the entire Eastern Archipelago, many merchants began to form unions and guilds to protect their common interests. The golden age of trade on the Myrtana Sea began.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_09_4": "Maximus' overseas victories did not bring him much popularity on the continent. The growing internal and external problems were also not helped by the fact that the king spent most of his reign abroad.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_10_1": "Many historians argue that Maximus could have prevented the rebellion by keeping soldiers in the colonies, who would have restrained the merchants' with fear or force. Others believe that it was King Domenico who directly laid the groundwork for the conflict by building a huge fleet.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_10_2": "However, it was only after Maximus' expedition that the merchants saw their opportunity. More and more they steered the course of trade in colonies. In time, they began to meddle with politics, enlist armies and introduce their own coinage. Many unions were then formed, which, under the banner of the Eastern League, renounced obedience to the king.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_10_3": "To the end of his days, Maximus believed that he would be able to appease the merchants. However, the negotiations failed every time. It was not until his son, Mandred the Grim, decided to use force. Out of high but necessary taxes, the king raised an army and moved it east.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_10_4": "Although the League had an excellent fleet, in less than a few months of fighting it lost control of most of its ports and its leaders were punished accordingly. Mandred restored peace to the colonies and established the only legitimate merchant organization, the Guild of Araxos.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_11_1": "Mandred's victory over the Eastern League strengthened the Kingdom of Myrtana in every way. Trade, which had previously been a gray area, came under strict control, and any signs of rebellion in the colonies were swiftly suppressed by trained and well-equipped city guards.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_11_2": "The increased number of soldiers and the centralization of power, while stabilizing the country internally, had no effect on the situation outside the borders of the kingdom. The Varrantians repeatedly violated the peace treaty, and the Nordmarians viewed the line of forts erected in the Borderlands with suspicion.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_11_3": "Some critics charged that Mandred risked too much to destabilize the country by planning war with Nordmar after the discovery of magic ore there. These plans, if they were indeed in the making, were put on hold by the sinking of a ship with the prince aboard.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_11_4": "Learning that corsairs from the Southern Islands were behind his son's death, the enraged Mandred began preparations for war, sending nearly all of his troops into the conflict. The conflict with the Southerners lasted many months, but despite small victories and the steadfastness of the Myrtanians, the king suffered irreparable losses and had to demand a retreat in disgrace.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_12_1": "When the bells in Vengard announced Mandred's death, mutineers led by Florens, the head of an aristocratic family from southern Myrtana, attempted to seize power.

	"WrittenText_InnosWill_12_2": "The Archmages once again seized power, making decisions with the support of the Council. This reign was not an easy one. Chronic droughts caused famine and with it came disease.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_12_3": "The villages near the border with Varrant became the target of regular raids from the south and bands of Nordmarians started to plunder the Borderlands. The troubled people longed for the impossible - the return of the King to the throne of Myrtana.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_12_4": "The Vengardian poet Widron described this time as the 'days of bile and decay' where all morality and compassion were forgotten. The rulers of Varrant and Nordmar took advantage of the chaos. By forming an alliance, they partitioned Myrtana, like vermin tearing apart this once beautiful land.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_13_1": "The hoofbeats of Varrantian cataphracts and the thud of Nordmarian boots could be heard from the Black Creek in the south to Siegburg in the north. Those who joined the invaders could enjoy life with the stigma of traitors, serving their new masters. For those who took up arms, awaited only death.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_13_2": "When the enemy reached Vengard, a miracle happened. Innos saved his children and turned the invaders against each other. In the meantime, a resistance organized by the archmages and led by a young officer rose up, liberating much of the country.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_13_3": "Just when there seemed to be a glimmer of hope the drums of war sounded again - this time from the west. Like a hateful wave, a horde of orcs swept across Myrtana, wreaking havoc. A young officer began an unequal fight with the enemy, gathering the inhabitants of the land under his banner.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_13_4": "The war lasted many years. Many lives were taken, and much of Myrtana was turned to ruin. However, the dedication of citizens managed to chase away the black clouds from the land hallowed by Innos, and the young leader, a symbol of hope and determination, was proclaimed as the new king of Myrtana - Rhobar II.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_14_1": "After the Great War with the Orcs, Rhobar II had to make many difficult but necessary decisions to ensure the integrity of the country.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_14_2": "From his colonies in the east, the king brought supplies and troops to defend Myrtana's borders. He also conquered a weakened Nordmar. This move, though criticized by Water Mages, gave the king access to valuable deposits of magic ore.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_14_3": "Rhobar's engineers developed a new kind of blackpowder weaponry. Soon the first cannons capable of hurling projectiles over long distances appeared on walls and ships.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_14_4": "The king sent brave paladins to the four corners of the world to rekindle the flame of Innos in the hearts of infidels.",
	"WrittenText_InnosWill_14_5": "Rhobar was the first ruler of Myrtana to invade Varrant. The forces of the south, led by the outstanding strategists Lukkor and Gellon, put up equal resistance to the Royal Guardsmen, but a brilliant maneuver by General Lee sealed the victory for the Myrtanians.",

	"WrittenText_Araxos_01_1": "From time immemorial man has longed to travel. No wonder, after all, they are embedded in our blood. Our ancestors already knew that expeditions are necessary to provide shelter and food for their loved ones. We were also driven by simple human curiosity. The desire to know what lies beyond the next hill, bay, and sea, caused our civilization to reach the limits of the currently known world.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_01_2": "Travel, however, not only expanded our knowledge of different lands and their inhabitants, but also contributed to many discoveries in science and crafts. To travel across the vast seas, we had to learn navigation based on the position of the sun and stars in the sky.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_01_3": "Sea voyages also required us to design and build sturdy boats and ships capable of carrying people and goods over long distances.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_01_4": "Over the years, man began to see the benefits of frequent travel. It allowed us to season our meals with spicy red pepper and enjoy the sweetness of honeyed tobacco at the end of a workday. Travel also caused the establishment of settlements on newly discovered lands, where local business flourished. Over time, the people who settled there began to form trade associations, from which emerged the incomparable 'Araxos' merchant guild.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_02_1": "Although today the leading in trade Araxos Guild and all its branches is an integral part of Myrtana, its origins are shrouded in a tumultuous conflict that challenged the economy of the kingdom for many years.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_02_2": "When news of King Maximus III's conquest of the Eastern Archipelago spread around the world, the new colonies became a temptation for many merchants, whose ships flocked to the new colonies. As Berfeld, then scribe of the Archolos City Hall, wryly observed, 'there were days when I saw more frigates in the harbor than debtors in my account book!'",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_02_3": "The king was at first pleased with the benefits that the fledgling colonies brought to trade. No wonder. Trade was, after all, a kind of spark that lit a fire in the economically ossified Myrtanian stove. Leather, weapons, tobacco and jewels came to the east. To the west, ships laden with wine, silver, salt and textiles sailed.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_02_4": "The plan, which at first bore fruit, began to turn against Maximus over time. The colonies, which were many miles away from Vengard, were more willing to accept the authority of the merchants than that of the king's envoys. The bolder, more self-sufficient posts, in turn, began to decide the economy and politics, and even minted their own coins.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_03_1": "King Maximus’ attempts to negotiate with merchants proved futile. The sails of their ships were less and less decorated with Myrtana's emblems, and instead they bore the symbols of newly founded unions and guilds. At the gates of trading posts, one could find not vendors, but armed to the teeth mercenaries.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_03_2": "Many blame King Domenico I for the outbreak of the rebellion, who years earlier had given traders a modern fleet. Although he undoubtedly gave the rebels the tools, the real initiator of the revolt was the wealthy merchant Delaverd.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_03_3": "Upon hearing of new colonies in the east, he moved to them his fortune and began investing in local resources, which he taxed heavily.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_03_4": "Delaverd soon became the most influential magnate in the Eastern Archipelago. The only thing that stood in his way of becoming a trade hegemon was the royal procedures, which significantly delayed the transport of goods on the continent. With the help of corsairs from local isles, Delaverd efficiently avoided the main merchant routes.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_04_1": "As Maximus, opening the islands of the Eastern Archipelago to the world, threw the bait to the merchants, so Delaverd decided to grab the whole rod. One night he and the leaders of the influential merchant guilds signed a treaty creating the 'Eastern League', which effectively took control of the colonies. The effects of his decision, however, were lamentable for the continent.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_04_2": "The royal treasury received only a fifth of the gold from the trade in goods, as a result of which the south of Myrtana was plagued by poverty, famine and disease. With time, people began to take to the streets of the cities, demanding decisive action from the authorities.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_04_3": "Rebellions and executions of royal emissaries ensued, and the country was plunged into chaos for many years.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_04_4": "Maximus was succeeded by his son, Mandred the Harsh, who vowed that he would not rest until the colonies returned to Myrtana. However, if the tales are to be believed, the real cause of the conflict was the dumping of an entire supply of swampweed into the sea before it reached the harbor of Vengard. The King, famous for his love of this once popular and legal stimulant, took the insult personally. War was inevitable.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_05_1": "The emptiness of the treasury did not give Mandred hope for a quick conscription of an army and an effective offensive. The king then decided to pardon some of the convicts, whom he ordered to be trained and armed in the manner of knechts. This decision caused strong opposition in the ranks of professional soldiers and commanders, but all signs of rebellion were nipped in the bud.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_05_2": "Despite the initial success of Mandred's campaign, the conflict stalled. The Eastern League, with its superior navy, easily won clashes at sea, cutting the Myrtanians off from regular supplies from the continent.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_05_3": "On land, the king's unleashed soldiers brought order to the rebellious populace with fire and sword.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_05_4": "Just when it seemed that neither side would be able to fully defeat the other, Mandred resorted to trickery. In a sham peace treaty with the governors of the Eastern League, Mandred used bribed merchants to slaughter his opponents, including Delaverd, putting an end to the rebellion.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_06_1": "With the death of the mutiny's leaders during the infamous 'Red Pacts', the Eastern League ceased to exist and so did the archipelago's dreams of autonomy. By decree, King Mandred appropriated some of the ships and assets of the trade associations and replaced the League with the Guild of Araxos, subordinate to the kingdom.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_06_2": "In addition, the ruler withdrew the coins minted by the merchants from circulation and established new trade routes, which from now on passed through checkpoints established by him. Although these decisions provided the kingdom with transparency in the circulation of goods, the economic losses were irreparable.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_06_3": "Most of the goods being transported arrived at their destination spoiled or damaged as a result of long days at sea or overzealous searches. Ships were often damaged or pirated during the voyage, and Mandred, who was at war with the Southerners at the time, was reluctant to spend resources on saving trade.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_06_4": "During the interregnum, and later the partition of Myrtana, the position of the Araxos Guild was bleak. Many of its trading posts were converted into hospitals for wounded soldiers and insurgents. In turn, the lack of an organized leadership and the divergence of policies brought more and more confusion to its ranks.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_07_1": "After the Great War with the Orcs, Rhobar II became a symbol of the kingdom's reconstruction. A ray of sunshine in a land strewn with death. For the Araxos Guild, it was three entrepreneurs who were elected to the organization's governing body.",

	"WrittenText_Araxos_08_1": "Not many years had passed when black clouds once again hung over the future of the Guild of Araxos. The Second War with the Orcs broke out, and after the collapse of the royal fleet at the Battle of the Eastern Archipelago, Rhobar II issued an edict claiming ownership of all ships in the seas - including merchant vessels.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_08_2": "The efforts of Ronja, archivist at the Trading Post on Archolos, proved that as a result of this decision, the Guild of Araxos lost twenty hulks, sixteen carracks, eight frigates and five galleons to the king.",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_08_3": "Although The Elder Council succeeded in convincing the Myrtanian authorities of the need for mercenary units, the losses caused by the confiscation of the ships are no longer counted in tens but hundreds of carts of gold. Since the rumors of pirates and orc galleys constantly recur, it can be assumed that the golden age of trade is over. People increasingly say that colonies cut off from the world would rather drown in internal conflicts than restore their former power. On the lips of merchants and sailors, however, there is just as often an old sailor's proverb:",
	"WrittenText_Araxos_08_4": "As long as the breeze blows, the blue sails of Araxos will flutter on the seas of the world.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_01_1": "The first records about the town known as ‘Holos’, meaning ‘everything that surrounds us’ date back many years before Volfzack's birth. The prefix ‘Arc’ (‘kingly’) was added when he became king. We can assume that the name ‘Archolos’ means ‘kingdom’.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_01_2": "Years before, island was home to many tribes. Volfzack, leader of the mountain tribe, wanted to end the era of conflict. He challenged the ruler of Archolos to a fight, which ended as soon as it started. Seeing their leader fall, people proclaimed Volfzack a king.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_01_3": "During the reign of ‘Wolf of Archolos’, the settlement consisted of nothing more than several clay-made huts and even fewer wooden houses inhabited by the rich. The stone keep of the ruler was situated in the eastern part of the town, near the mountain range where today the Old Town is located.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_01_4": "Up north from there, was a fishing hamlet which in time expanded to the size of a village. Volfzack, aware of the evident profits of seafaring, joined the seaside settlement to the town and erected a high fence around the entire agglomeration.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_02_1": "After the conquest of Archolos by king Maximus III, the island fell into the hands of Myrtanians, and with it began the age of grand changes.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_02_2": "The new ruler promised to pardon people who were once loyal to Volfzack’s sons. The king allowed them to keep their offices under one condition - they had to bow their heads before Innos and consider Maximus their new ruler.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_02_3": "The king also conducted reforms of administration. Many solutions utilised in Vengard were introduced at that time. Although in the effect the old culture was rooted out of the city, the management vastly improved ever since.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_02_4": "Another step the new ruler took was getting rid of the elders. In their place, a governor together with judges and their deputies were appointed. In time, when the new system began to function properly, the latter were delegated to other duties, and a new office of the royal scribe was created, focused on citizens’ matters.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_02_5": "Even long years after the conquest, Maximus was aware of the risk of rebellion. Thus, he decided to leave the garrison of the royal guard in Archolos until a trained unit of a City Guard is created.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_03_1": "The work of rebuilding Archolos by the Myrtanian style began with replacing gravel paths with paved roads intertwined with arcades and overpasses erected by a famous sculptor Alberto of Khorinis. At the same time, the building of the town sewers began, which were meant to help residents get rid of waste.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_03_2": "Before the Myrtanian invasion, most of the huts and houses in the town were constructed of wood, and thus, they were vulnerable to natural forces. To increase their durability, the authorities reinforced stone buildings using the timber framing method, widely used across Myrtana.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_03_3": "The changes also occurred within the Old Town. Due to strategic reasons, Maximus decided to tear down old quarters that had belonged to elders and replace them with a town hall. He also demolished the wooden palisade surrounding the Old Town and erected stone walls together with two gates. As the years went by, another two were added in the middle.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_03_4": "In the western part of Archolos, in no more than a year, the authorities built a magnificent Church of Innos next to the small chapel which remembers the days of the invasion. It is the highest building in town to this day and serves as a significant landmark.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_04_1": "Maximus knew that the true protection to the growing town can provide only durable fortifications, so he surrounded the entire urban area with stone walls. Later, the king also erected a wide barbican protecting the western gate.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_04_2": "Words about the king’s victory on Archolos swept the seas in just a few weeks. Merchants, adventurers, and common people alike would come to the shores on their boats, cutters, and frigates hoping to better their financial situation. It was not long before the town streets would be teeming with outsiders from all around the world.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_04_3": "Seeing great numbers of refugees crowding in, governor Godfrey expanded the harbour area and appointed a group of additional officials to better control the newcomers. On the other hand, to ease the hardship of their journey, he allowed them to build temporary huts near the shore.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_04_4": "But nobles of Archolos did not trust foreigners and demanded to close the town borders indefinitely. Although this decision would appease one, influential group of citizens, it would also plunge the entire region into an economic crisis. Godfrey had to tread lightly, as every decision was bound to a risk.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_05_1": "Although Godfrey did not want to take any side, he had a plan up his sleeve. The governor divided Archolos into districts, hoping to better control the influx of foreigners skilled in different trades.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_05_2": "The first district was the Old Town, where only the rich citizens of Archolos were allowed to live. After that, a Residential District was built for the middle class, which until today remains the largest of all, stretching between both outer gates. Later, the craftsman district was created, which gathered people working in different trades.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_05_3": "As the last one, the Merchant District was demarcated, which initially covered the area of today’s barracks, the western part of the town, and the temple district. Each of the districts was also separated with a specific building layout, designed in a way to help people move around the town.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_05_4": "Although the governor’s plan had its merits, some openly opposed it. The indigenous residents accused authorities of segregating people on those of better stock - foreign, and the worse - local. And they were partly right. Nobles simply refused to breathe the same air as commoners.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_06_1": "Despite dividing the town into separate districts, foreigners still crowded in the harbour. Each with a story to tell, experience and prejudices. An overpopulated shore more and more resembled a pot that could spill at any moment.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_06_2": "Determined to stop the uncontrollable influx of outsiders, the governor built a wall on the border with the harbour guarded by Royal Guard. His decision angered foreigners, who started a revolt which lasted many days.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_06_3": "Although the uprising was brutally quenched, it was never forgotten.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_06_4": "The outsiders tried to make their ends meet in any way possible. Smuggling and uncontrolled trade of swamp weed flourished on Archolos which forced Maximus to put an embargo on its distribution.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_06_5": "The line between the rich and the poor was more and more visible, and people’s trust in authorities was forever tarnished. It was the time when the faith in Innos weakened amongst commoners, and the religion of Adanos, increased. Water Mages took advantage of this tendency and built a chapel in the harbour, which to this day remains open for the sick and the poor.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_07_1": "After the unsuccessful conquest of Contir and Glenwyr, the king returned to the mainland and took with him almost the entire army. This decision was met with mixed feelings from the inhabitants of Archolos. The locals were afraid of another rebellion. Foreigners, on the other hand, saw their chance for gaining more rights. The governor made sure that all of them were content.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_07_2": "From the selected group of citizens, Godfrey appointed a unit of the City Guard, tasked to maintain law and order after the king’s departure. Soon after, the barracks were built in the middle of the town.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_07_3": "Regular guardsmen and elite companies of crossbowmen became an armed wing of Archolos.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_07_4": "The governor also simplified the way of obtaining citizenship by foreigners. Instead of waiting long years for their turn, all they had to do was convince several influential people in the town about their usefulness to society.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_07_5": "Eventually, envoys of many guilds and trade companies began to invest their wealth into local markets. There was plenty of work with transporting goods, as well as in sale, thus many new opportunities were opened for citizens and foreigners alike.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_08_1": "Godfrey should have listened to the words of an old scribe, Holger - ‘Never trust a merchant. Give them a finger, and they’ll chop your hand off - not for what you hold in it, but for that ring you’re wearing!’ But Holger died, and soon after Godfrey, both of an unspecified illness.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_08_2": "The new governor, Karsten, despite high hopes - for he was of noble blood - was a mediocre administrator and even worse politician. He did nothing to resolve the ‘troll problem’ in the sewers, and as a result, people began to spill all the filth right on the streets, as they do to this day on Londram.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_08_3": "Some began to suspect that the governor is but a puppet in the hands of trade guilds, which have been gaining more and more power in town. The doubts were quelled the moment Karsten realised that he no longer needed the support of the Town Council, whose members he drove out of the town hall.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_08_4": "The governor befriended, however, a group of merchants with a Myrtanian trade magnate, Delaverd. If the stories are true, during a night-long libation, Karsten signed a treaty appointing the ‘Easter League’ which led to declaring an open rebellion against the crown.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_09_1": "Although at first, it could appear that Karsten fell victim to his fondness for beverages, the document was signed and in time the governor began to realize what he had done. The 'Eastern League ’became a fact.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_09_2": "Banners of Myrtana disappeared from the town hall building, walls, and city gates, and in their place appeared a sign of a triple knot, symbolizing the islands of Archolos, Londram, and Contir which first revolted against the kingdom. After them, Laran, Eritros, and smaller islands of the New Lands and Eastern Archipelago seceded from Myrtana.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_09_3": "Patrols of the City Guard were replaced by groups of mercenaries serving not law but coin. Karsten understood what he had done with a single swing of his quill, however, it was too late to stop the chain of events. In his grief, the governor threw himself from the highest window of the town hall, to save his name from an entire shame.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_09_4": "The king of Myrtana, Mandred, decided to quench the rebellion by sending a well-equipped armed force across the sea. Although the war only grazed Archolos, hastily formed units of men-at-arms laid waste to the countryside, murdering, pillaging, and burning whatever they found on their way.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_10_1": "Having lost contact with most of its harbour towns, the fleet of the Eastern League was defeated, and the organisation itself dissolved. King Mandred brought peace to the rebelled colonies and rebuilt the administrative system. He also appointed the only legal merchant union in Myrtana - the Araxos Guild.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_10_2": "One of the first guild houses emerged on Archolos in the western part of the Merchant District. Many years later, governor Morris allowed the guild’s chairman to build quarters for mercenaries, people who sought fame and fortune in the service of the organisation.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_10_3": "After the fall of the Eastern League, patrols of the City Guard returned to the streets, but their old prestige did not. They lacked discipline and equipment, which made people doubt the efficiency of order in Archolos. Only today, under captain Roderich, the City Guard began to regain its respect.",
	"WrittenText_HistoryOfCity_10_4": "Years passed, and Archolos managed to overcome storms that crashed against it. Its people, however, no longer resemble their forefathers. They are proud and hardened in the fire of history and ready to face the winds of war which slowly blow closer to their home.",
	"WrittenText_Language_01_1": "The poet Widron in one of his works wrote: 'there are as many languages in the world as there are stars in the sky.' This is partially true. Whether you are in Vengard, Khorinis or Archolos, you are bound to encounter people from all corners of the world speaking different dialects.",
	"WrittenText_Language_01_2": "You'll find mercenaries from the Southern Islands, armed to the teeth, merchants from Middle Varrant selling their wares to the locals for half-price and grumpy Nordmarians spending their days in taverns.",
	"WrittenText_Language_01_3": "Although each of them speaks western tongue, a set of common linguistic rules that facilitate communication, it is impossible not to notice some discrepancies.",
	"WrittenText_Language_01_4": "Vengardian use characteristic hard consonants. The inhabitants of Archolos, on the other hand, have trouble articulating the melodious names of newcomers from southern Myrtana.",
	"WrittenText_Language_01_5": "Believers will say that Innos tangled people's tongues as punishment for them bowing to Beliar. Scholars, however, will say that the diversity of dialects and accents in the world is rooted in the natural process of the development of different cultures.",
	"WrittenText_Language_02_1": "Languages and dialects were, are and will be artificial creations, created not as divine intervention, but as one of the key elements of the process of formation of different cultures in different regions of the world. To better understand their issue, I will use examples.",
	"WrittenText_Language_02_2": "Native Vengardians, but also newcomers who wish to be understood, often clearly articulate certain elements of speech, especially in names of foreign origin. The southern name 'Sahrad' is spoken by them literally. The people of Zandir Sol, on the other hand, read it as 'sarad' with the hard consonant 'h' omitted.",
	"WrittenText_Language_02_3": "The linguistic differences, however, are not only at the level of speech, but also in the way words are accented. The inhabitants of the Eastern Archipelago stress the first syllable when pronouncing their own names. In the word 'Archolos', however, the stress on the syllable 'Ar' may also have historical connotations, as the name of the island was once devoid of the prefix 'Arc-'.",
	"WrittenText_Language_02_4": "Language is a fluid thing, depending on where the people who speak it were born. However, it is also a kind of richness. We should still keep the memory of our roots alive by nurturing accents and dialects before they can be found only between the pages of history.",

The key to success in this fight is knowing the different types of damage, defense and their interrelationships.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Meele_2": "The most common type of damage you will experience is edge damage otherwise known as damage from blades. These come from all kinds of swords, spears, and axes, as well as claws and fangs of monsters. Its overall usefulness is very high, but in few fights it gives a significant advantage.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Meele_3": "The next type of damage is the blunt damage. Such damage is done by mace, hammers, fists, and many monsters that strike with a large paw or head. Blows are especially effective against heavy armor, bones, or boulders.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Meele_4": "Ranged weapons always cause projectile wounds. Like edge wounds, they have high overall utility, but in a few cases they are practically useless - arrows bounce off stone or even thick leather, and hitting skeleton bones is not easy either.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic_1": "The hardest type of damage to describe by far is flight, wind, and fall damage. This is a very diverse category that includes attacks that are not very common. No armor has yet been created to protect against these types of wounds - each creature has its own resistance to them.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic_2": "For humans, learned acrobatics may prove to be the only additional protection, as it allows them to properly distribute the energy of the blow. Usually, the larger and heavier the creature, the greater the resistance, while light and bony creatures are extremely susceptible to them.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic_3": "The next type of damage is magic damage - and it comes directly from spells.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic_4": "Additionally, most spells also cause an elemental reaction, which can weaken or strengthen the damage depending on the creature that is subjected to it.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic_5": "Water can shatter stone into tiny pieces, fire can incinerate the undead, and lightning can instantly kill flying creatures.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic_6": "Poison and acid damage from certain toxic creatures works in a similar fashion.",

	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic2_3": "Don't underestimate the weakness of a certain magic! Lightning, for example, doesn't need a downpour to do massive damage to water.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic2_4": "The last type of damage is fire damage and should not be confused with the fire elemental reaction mentioned earlier.",
	"WrittenText_TypeOfDamage_Magic2_5": "Fire defense allows you to protect yourself from flames coming from a non-magical source - such as a fire lizard's breath - as well as from burning effects caused after being hit by a fire spell.",

	"WrittenText_Wine_01_1": "For some people, wine is an essential drink for peasants and lords alike, for others it is an important part of the daily ritual. As Cynred, a long-time advisor of King Mandred, rightly observed: 'the role and importance of wine are changing as fast as the opinion of politicians'.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_01_2": "Famous for their distrust of strangers, people from Glenwyr tend to drink a lot. Not without reason, they have adopted the adage: 'iron can be known through fire, man can be known through wine'. Londramians, on the other hand, like to seal their meetings with wine.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_01_3": "In time, wine brought the interest of medics and barbers, for whom this drink became almost synonymous with medicine. The latter liked its analgesic properties so much that they assured their clients: 'After a cup of red, you will feel neither iron nor fire!'",
	"WrittenText_Wine_01_4": "Alchemists, on the other hand, repeat like a mantra: 'After a cup you will take away the pain from the body. After two, you will soothe the soul. After three, you will knock on the gates of Innos'. They were the first to discover that consuming large amounts of wine can have a detrimental effect on human health.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_02_1": "Although people began to be aware of the harmfulness of wine abuse, in no way did this knowledge affect wine consumption. When someone happened to overdo, an adage popular in the time of King Maximus was invoked: 'He who drinks wine sleeps well. He who sleeps well is free from sin. He who does not sin goes to the bosom of Innos.'",
	"WrittenText_Wine_02_2": "Philus, the Archmage of Fire from the monastery on the island of Eritros, took this sentence to heart. The priest discovered that this beverage, when properly prepared, has certain magical properties.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_02_3": "True to his word, he was so engrossed in his research that he and his brothers locked the gates of the sanctuary for seven full days, during which 'the High Council partied like a group of jesters'.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_02_4": "Shortly after these events, the Archmages of Vengard recalled Philus, and wine arriving to monasteries began to be diluted with water. Despite that, abbeys continued to produce wine. It was not until Archmage Witger issued an edict, under which he ordered the priests to consume as much wine 'to have the strength to stand on their feet during the service'.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_03_1": "The author of 'First Power', Geber, argues that wine is a gift from heaven, belittling the invaluable role of winemakers in the production of this drink. While this is undoubtedly a complicated process, I will present you with four key steps that will prove that the credit goes to man first and foremost.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_03_2": "A skilled vintner must know when to pick and when to leave the fruit. If he picks them too early, they may turn out inedible and the taste of the wine will be tart. If he picks them too late, the taste will be too sweet and some grapes will simply rot. Pick one grape from each bush and taste it, then you will know if it is the right time.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_03_3": "After you have picked the grapes, place them in a tub where you mash them. Do this carefully and patiently, and the fruit will certainly thank you by releasing its juices. Then, put the must in a vat covered with sheepskins for a few days to start the fermentation process. From time to time, push the skins and twigs up to the surface.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_03_4": "Once you think your wine is starting to get strong and clear, pour it through strainers into oak barrels and seal tightly for one or two springs. After that time you can pour the wine into more barrels and wait half of that time to achieve the desired taste, color and texture.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_04_1": "Although the production of wine is dependent on the skill and experience of winemakers, it is not uncommon for their efforts to fail and for the beverage prepared for months or years to rot. Many methods have been devised to deal with the acidity of wine.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_04_2": "A popular way to preserve wine is to add sulphur to it. If stories are true, a merchant, called Clement of Sendar, came up with the idea and accidentally poured a stock of 20-year-old beverage into a barrel filled with sulphur.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_04_3": "When he opened the lid many months later and saw what he had done, he realised that the taste and texture remained the same.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_04_4": "Another method, favoured by Myrtanian winemakers, involves pouring a thick layer of oil or molerat tallow on top of the ageing wine. This method is also used for sealing bottles with wine, which necks are additionally protected with wax.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_04_5": "Before pouring wine into barrels, many winemakers add honey, herbs and spices to improve the taste. However, there are con artists who cleverly use this procedure to hide the nasty taste of cheap wine, which is often nothing more than a by-product of the maceration process.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_05_1": "Knowledge of making and preserving wine is often not enough to keep it from spoiling. Many merchants, however, have no qualms about selling bottles of stale wine. Valerio, the owner of a vineyard on Archolos, used to comment on this state of affairs with the words: 'you won't believe how much of that shit they sell to people at the markets'.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_05_2": "Peter of Montillia believed that the process of winemaking starts not from harvesting, but from planting the bushes. He proved that volcanic soil has unique properties and that plants grow faster there than those planted anywhere else in the world.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_05_3": "Although, like any exemplary Montillian, he practised using a row system with supports for the bushes, he suggested leaning the vines against trees as an alternative method. This is because they are supposed to ensure the free and natural development of the plant.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_05_4": "A Southern Islands winemaker, Kerhima, wrote in her diary valuable observations about the work in the vineyard itself. She believed that the stage of crushing the fruits should be preceded by washing the vessel with salted water. This treatment was proven to purify the wine, making it excellent for medicinal purposes.",
	"WrittenText_Wine_06_1": "If you ask a winemaker about the cradle of wine, you will hear stories about the picturesque hills and valleys of southern Myrtana. But if you tell him to point you to the beating heart of this drink, he will say it's Archolos.",

	"WrittenText_Wine_06_6": "During one of the evening tastings at a local hostelry, the owners of both vineyards finally decided to bury the hatchet. After much negotiation (and many emptied goblets of wine), they agreed that the island was big enough for both of them.",

	"WrittenText_StingsDrinking_3": "However, not all of the substance in the sting is dangerous. If you break it in half vigorously, you can drink all the liquid in its back part with a quick sip.",
	"WrittenText_StingsDrinking_4": "Research has shown that only the secretion closest to the stinger gains lethal properties through a complex process of  'ripening' of the poison inside the body of the flying killer. The drinkable liquid, however, has amazing healing properties. Even a single dose can bring any warrior back to his feet.",
	"WrittenText_StingsDrinking_5": "Unfortunately, with each dose, the body becomes resistant to the positive effects of the poison and, after some time, the consumption of the stinging secretion may become completely ineffective. However, many hunters point out that along with the immunity, the overall condition of the body also improves, which is a plus for their use.",
	"WrittenText_MandiblesDrinking_1": "Many powerful mages have studied crawlers to learn the secrets hidden in the secretions from their mandibles.

	"WrittenText_MandiblesDrinking_2": "The proper opening of the mandibles, so that the liquids from the two compartments do not combine with each other, allows them to be consumed in complete safety. These fluids are supposed to immediately and fully regenerate the mage's spiritual powers.",
	"WrittenText_MandiblesDrinking_3": "There are also reports of extremely rare side effects such as hallucinations and obsessive disorders, but if research is to be believed, these only occur in extreme cases when the secretion is combined with prolonged exposure to other stimulants.",
	"WrittenText_MandiblesDrinking_4": "Unfortunately, as with bloodfly stingers, the effect of the mandibles also has its limitations - after repeated use, the body slowly begins to develop an immunity and further consumption of the secretion seems to have no effect. However, many mages report that with the increase in immunity to the stinger, the overall magical potential increases.",
