  "SVM_16_AMB_SILBACH_FEMALE_WHATSNEW_CH2_01": "There are more and more people on the island, yet there is a shortage of workers. I am not suggesting anything, but our guests themselves are working on their reputation.",

  "SVM_37_AMB_KINGS_MINE_GUARDS_ABOUTMINE_POSTSQ311_V1_01": "It's a very good source of income, which is why it's so important to guard it from all sorts of bad guys. Like the ones you helped get rid of.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_ABOUTCITY_V1_02": "You can also look around the Artisans' District, but prepare a bigger purse before visiting it.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_ABOUTSEWERS_V1_01": "You must have a damn good reason for going there!",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_ABOUTSEWERS_V1_02": "Most of the residents who ventured there never came back...",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_CITIZENSHIP_V1": "The issuing of the relevant documents is handled by Matey. His office is located at the market square, you will recognize it by the big queue in front of the door.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_SLUMS_MALE_ABOUTHARBOR_V1_01": "Have you visited the Siren's Wail yet? I think it's the only decent place in this shitty town.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_OLDTOWN_MALE_ABOUTMORRIS_V1_01": "He's the reason the city still functions. Everyone here is grateful for his hard work.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_OLDTOWN_MALE_ABOUTOLDTOWN_V1_02": "Whenever I leave this district, I immediately feel jealous stares on me. Once I even had the impression that someone was approaching me with a dagger in his hand. I am afraid to do anything there.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_HOMELESS_MALE_ABOUTCITY_V1": "Don't trust this town and take every opportunity you can to make money, otherwise you'll end up like me.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_SEWERS_MALE_ABOUTSEWERS_V1_01": "Never venture into the depths if you don't have a decent supply of torches. Without them, you'll be lost before you realize it, and no one will be looking for you.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_REFUGEE_MALE_WHATSNEW_V1": "This place is very foreign to me. It will be hard for me to get used to it. Innos, may you protect us...",
  "SVM_37_AMB_NOVICE_ABOUTMONASTARY_V1": "The monastery is a wonderful place. Nowhere else on the island can you feel the power of Adanos like here, I recommend you use it for sincere prayer.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_NOVICE_ABOUTWATERMAGES_V1": "The Mages are the priests of Adanos and my mentors. They make sure that I acquire the knowledge and necessary skills well, and they also take care of my spiritual development.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_NOVICE_WHATSNEW_V1": "There are more and more needy people on the island. I hope to be able to help them.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_USURER_WHATSNEW_WHITEDAY_V1": "Look, I'd love to talk, but things have been a mess lately, and we need to get this under control as soon as possible.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_USURER_WHATSNEW_V1": "If you were counting for a friendly chat, you counted badly.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_USURER_ABOUTVOLKER_V1": "He's a man of principle. Some say he's cruel, but that's not true. He just pays a lot of attention to the deals he makes.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_USURER_WHATSHOULDIKNOWABOUTCITY_V1": "It's big. Pretty. Nasty. Dangerous here and there, and the best place to go for beer is Gerstand's.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_LUMBER_ABOUTARCHOLOS_V1": "Probably not much more than the others. The largest island in the archipelago, capital of culture, economic powerhouse. Though with the war, that's becoming increasingly untrue.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_LUMBER_ABOUTARCHOLOS_V1_IFBEASTISALIVE": "An island full of possibilities, but it can be damn dangerous. Just think of that Beast murdering the villagers!",
  "SVM_37_AMB_COALS_ABOUTARENA_V1": "It's the best place to burn coal on Archolos, but it also has its drawbacks. Mostly the kind with sharp fangs and claws.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_ROYAL_GUARD_ABOUTGUARDS_V1": "We are Myrtana's most skilled warriors, right next to the paladins. We differ from them only in that we protect the most important officials, not mages.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_ROYAL_GUARD_ABOUTKING_V1": "Our reigning ruler Rhobar II is a very wise man and takes all measures to protect the kingdom from the orc plague.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_ARXMINERS_HOWSTHINGS_V1": "I can barely manage to make the standard, but what can I do...",
  "SVM_37_AMB_ARXMINERS_ABOUTMINE_V1": "What's there to say? It's a gold mine owned by Araxos. There's not much more to know.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_ARXMINERS_HOWSWORK_V1": "Like a condemned man to the beheading.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_ARXMINERS_HOWSWORK_POSTQA306_V1": "Compared to what came before? Pretty good.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_KINGSMINERS_HOWSWORK_V1": "It's not a tragedy, I manage to make the norm every day, so no one picks on me.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_KINGSMINERS_ABOUTMINE_V1": "This is the only salt mine on the island. The goods from here go only to the wealthiest residents of the kingdom, so the guards watch us carefully.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_SOUTHERN_WHATSHOULDIKNOWABOUTARCHOLOS_V1": "It's big, and I still get the impression that people can barely fit on this island. Maybe it's a matter of setting up such huge houses here.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITYGUARD_NOGUILD_JOIN_V1_01": "Talk about it with our commander, Roderich. He will explain everything to you step by step.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITYGUARD_NOGUILD_JOIN_V1_02": "Don't expect an easy job. The Guard doesn't take just anyone.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITYGUARD_ABOUTCITYGUARD_V1_01": "We're in charge of keeping order in the city. Archolos is very large, so we generally have our hands full.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITYGUARD_ABOUTCITYGUARD_V1_02": "Now in addition we have to deal with the consequences of the war affecting the island, so service is definitely not for everyone.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITYGUARD_ABOUTRODERICH_V1_01": "He's a great commander who, even after losing his best men sent to the front, manages to keep the organization together.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_CITYGUARD_ABOUTRODERICH_V1_02": "If not for his determination and charisma, the Guard would have fallen apart long ago.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_WORKER_HOWSWORK_V1": "Pretty smooth. I tap here with a hammer, pin something there, and then I wait for payment.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_WORKER_WHATSHOULDIKNOWABOUTCITY_V1": "First and foremost is that everyone here is only looking out for their own best interests, so grab any job they offer you.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_SAILORS_WHATSNEW_V1": "And what can be heard on land? Only bad news about the front and the dire situation on the island.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_SAILORS_WHATSHOULDIKNOWABOUTCITY_V1": "A city like a city, an island like an island. Only everything here is big and visible from far away.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_FASTTRAVELBOATS_WHATSNEW_V1": "The waters around the island are strangely empty now because of Rhobar's ban. I can't get used to it.",
  "SVM_37_AMB_RITASVINEYARD_MALE_WHATSNEW_CH1AND2": "Everything is the same, and that's what I love about this place. I'm glad we're not as big a farm as Valerio's vineyard, there they probably can't keep up with the amount of work.",
  "SVM_49_AMB_FARMERS_WOLFSDEN_MALE_WHATSNEW_V1": "Our crops may be modest, but they are our own and are quite sufficient. We don't have to worry about being cut off from the rest of the island.",
  "SVM_49_AMB_FISHERMANS_MALE_HOWSWORK_V1": "I've been catching more shoes than fish lately. I'll be honest, it scares me. The owners of these shoes are not likely to swim to shore.",
  "SVM_49_AMB_SCOUNDREL_ABOUTHARBOR_V1_02": "Here everyone is responsible for themselves, also I advise you well, don't stick your nose into things that are not your own.",
  "SVM_59_AMB_MERCARAXOS_ABOUTLORENZO_V2_01": "He can easily find good business where others fail to see it. It is because of him that our Guild has grown so well.",
  "SVM_59_AMB_OLDTOWN_MALE_ABOUTOLDTOWN_V2_02": "Take my word for it, but once you live here, you won't want to leave.",
  "SVM_59_AMB_NOVICE_ABOUTWATERMAGES_V2": "Mages are very important to the people of Archolos. They heal them, support them in times of need, and help resolve conflicts. Without them, the island would be very different",
  "SVM_59_AMB_ROYAL_GUARD_WHATSNEW_CH3": "The only thing missing from all this mess was assassinating the rich. But don't worry, Royal Guard can handle it.",
  "SVM_59_AMB_ROYAL_GUARD_WHATSNEW_CH4": "Guardsmen, with the support of the city guard, will handle all threats.",
  "SVM_59_AMB_ARXMINERS_HOWSWORK_V2": "It would go better if they let us rest more often.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_FARMERS_CITY_MALE_ABOUTTHISPLACE_V3_02": "If you're short on cash, don't think twice about entering the city by sea. They have armed guards there, you'll be a dead man before you get to shore.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_WOLFSONS_ABOUTDEN_V3_01": "Here is the home of all the sons and daughters who have had their own lands taken from them. Now we watch with heartache as the island becomes a shadow of its former glory.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_WOLFSONS_WHATSNEW_CH4_PREENTRENCE_01": "This is what the king's orders lead to. An army of homeless people camped outside our walls.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_ABOUTCITY_V3_02": "And if you visit Gerstand right afterwards, you won't need anything else!",
  "SVM_61_AMB_SEWERS_MALE_HOWSLIFE_CH4": "What I'd give for a decent hot meal. Just the thought makes my stomach churn.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_SEWERS_MALE_ABOUTSEWERS_V3_02": "If you want to go deep, stock up on a pair of torches. It's better to see what's being thrown at you.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_SEWERS_MALE_WHYAREYOUHERE_V3_02": "In my situation, that is what determines everything, not the desire for comforts.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_COALS_ABOUTARENA_V3": "I can certainly admit that it has its charms. There are few places on the island where I am able to relax like here.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_ROYAL_GUARD_ABOUTGUARDS_V3": "Each of us started our training as a teenager. This is the only way we can become champions in our prime physical years.",
  "SVM_61_AMB_FASTTRAVELBOATS_WHATAREYOUDOING": "For a few coins, I'll let you board my boat, and then we'll go wherever you want. Within Archolos, of course, so there's no misunderstanding.",
  "SVM_61_DIA_MIL_Late_03_03": "Commander Roderich regrets your absence and reiterates the order to come to the barracks for new orders.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_SILBACH_MALE_WHOSINCHARGE_V3_02": "You can't forget about Lokvar, either. Arguing with a water mage is asking for trouble.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_FISHERMANS_MALE_NEIGHBORHOOD_V3_02": "When ever you see a seashark, run away as fast as you can. I myself have seen several Araxos hunters agonize to knock down just one specimen.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_CITIZENSHIP_V3": "All official matters are handled by Matey. His office is located on the street leading from the market to the Church District.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_SLUMS_MALE_ABOUTSLUMS_V3_02": "It's better if you leave.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_SLUMS_MALE_ABOUTHARBOR_V3_02": "When your home becomes a place like this, you're going to quit having fun kneeling in front of stone statues.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_VALERIO_MALE_HOWSLIFE_CH4AND5_PEACE": "The collaboration between Holdwig and Andreas is exactly what this winery has been missing. I don't think we were this successful even in Valerio's time!",
  "SVM_64_AMB_MERC_ARX_MINE_HOWSTHINGS_POSTQA306_CH3_01": "You've created quite a revolution here. But well, Bloodwyn was like an ulcer on the most inaccessible region of the body.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_CITIZEN_MALE_WHATSNEW_CH3_WHITEDAY": "Why should we deal with these refugees? We have our own problems too, we have to think about ourselves too.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_ARXGUIDE_ISLAND_ABOUTARCHOLOS_02": "No wonder it is such an important region for a kingdom at war. Much of Rhobar's campaign is funded by the money here.",
  "SVM_64_AMB_CITYGUARD_WHATSNEW_CH2": "It's okay. Some strangers have been popping up around here lately, but I can live with it.",
  "SVM_64_DIA_BAU_ValerioVine_SQ225_Question_03_14": "Judging by your face, are you one of those people who never let up?",

  "SVM_64_DIA_SLD_Late_08_03": "Chairman Lorenzo relays that you are going to have your legs pulled out of your ass. He'll only change his mind if you show up at the Guild's Trading Post and take the appropriate orders.",

  "SVM_67_AMB_WOLFSONS_ABOUTDEN_V2_02": "We have our traditions and we're not going to change that.",
  "SVM_67_AMB_MERC_ARX_MINE_ABOUTMERCS_POSTQA306_V2_01": "We know our job like like our own pockets. Complaints about our services are rare, and when they do appear, they are mostly crap, not worth worrying about.",
  "SVM_67_AMB_KINGS_MINE_GUARDS_ABOUTMINE_POSTSQ311_V2_01": "It is one of the three important mines on the island, along with the Araxos mine and the Ulryk's mine. Among this group it is the most important for the kingdom, as all profits go to the treasury.",
  "SVM_67_AMB_OLDTOWN_MALE_WHATSNEW_CH4_GRAYSON": "I'm glad the king's guards are coming. I feel safer knowing that such men are protecting us.",

  "SVM_67_AMB_SAILORS_WHATSHOULDIKNOWABOUTCITY_V2": "The only city still stunningly impressive from Archolos is Vengard. I'm telling you, when it's all over, you need to sail there.",
  "SVM_69_AMB_SILBACH_FEMALE_ABOUTVILLAGE_V1_01": "It's not good. Because of the war, our village has become a favorite stop for all sorts of problems and refugees.",
  "SVM_69_AMB_FARMERS_WOLFSDEN_FEMALE_WHATSNEW_V2": "I still can't get used to the climate here. You definitely won't find a cooler place on the island.",
